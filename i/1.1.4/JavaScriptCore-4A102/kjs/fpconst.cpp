// This file exists because JavaScriptCore needs to define the NaN and Inf globals in a way
// that does not use a static initializer so we don't have a framework initialization routine.

// The trick is to define the NaN and Inf globals with a different type than the declaration.
// This trick works because the mangled name of the globals does not include the type, although
// I'm not sure that's guaranteed. There could be alignment issues with this, since arrays of
// characters don't necessarily need the same alignment doubles do, but for now it seems to work.
// It would be good to figure out a 100% clean way that still avoids code that runs at init time.
