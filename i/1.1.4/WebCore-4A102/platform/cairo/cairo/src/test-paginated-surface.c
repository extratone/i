/* This isn't a "real" surface, but just something to be used by the
 * test suite to help exercise the paginated-surface paths in cairo.
 *
 * The defining feature of this backend is that it uses a paginated
 * surface to record all operations, and then replays everything to an
 * image surface.
 *
 * It's possible that this code might serve as a good starting point
 * for someone working on bringing up a new paginated-surface-based
 * backend.
