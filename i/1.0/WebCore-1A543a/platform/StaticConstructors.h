// For WebCore we need to avoid having static constructors.
// Our strategy is to declare the global objects with a different type (initialized to 0)
// and then use placement new to initialize the global objects later. This is not completely
// portable, and it would be good to figure out a 100% clean way that still avoids code that
// runs at init time.

#if !AVOID_STATIC_CONSTRUCTORS
    // Define an global in the normal way.
#define DEFINE_GLOBAL(type, name, ...) \
    const type name;
#else
// Define an correctly-sized array of pointers to avoid static initialization.
// Use an array of pointers instead of an array of char in case there is some alignment issue.
#define DEFINE_GLOBAL(type, name, ...) \
    void * name[(sizeof(type) + sizeof(void *) - 1) / sizeof(void *)];
#endif
