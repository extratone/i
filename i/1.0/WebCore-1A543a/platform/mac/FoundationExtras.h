// nil-checked CFRetain/CFRelease covers for Objective-C ids

// Use CFRetain, CFRelease, HardRetain, or HardRelease instead of
// -[NSObject retain] and -[NSObject release] if you want to store
// a pointer to an Objective-C object into memory that won't
// be scanned for GC, like a C++ object.

// As if CF and Foundation had logically separate reference counts,
// this function first increments the CF retain count, and then
// decrements the NS retain count. This is needed to handle cases where
// -retain/-release aren't equivalent to CFRetain/HardRelease, such as
// when GC is used.

// Use HardRetainWithNSRelease after allocating and initializing a NSObject
// if you want to store a pointer to that object into memory that won't
// be scanned for GC, like a C++ object.
