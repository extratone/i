// NSObject (WebScripting) ----------------------------------------------------- 

/*
    The methods in WebScripting are optionally implemented by classes whose
    interfaces are exported (wrapped) to a web scripting environment.  The 
    scripting environment currently supported by WebKit uses the JavaScript
    language.
    
    Instances automatically reflect their interfaces in the scripting environment.  This
    automatic reflection can be overridden using the class methods defined in the WebScripting
    informal protocol.
    
    Access to the attributes of an instance is done using KVC. Specifically the following
    KVC methods:
	
        - (void)setValue:(id)value forKey:(NSString *)key
        - (id)valueForKey:(NSString *)key
	
    Instances may also intercept property set/get operations and method invocations that are
    made by the scripting environment, but not reflected.  This is done using the KVC
    methods:

        - (void)setValue:(id)value forUndefinedKey:(NSString *)key
        - (id)valueForUndefinedKey:(NSString *)key
    
    If clients need to raise an exception in the script environment
    they can call [WebScriptObject throwException:].  Note that throwing an
    exception using this method will only succeed if the method that throws the exception
    is being called within the scope of a script invocation.
    
    By default all attributes, as defined by KVC, will be exposed.  However, a
    class may further exclude properties that they do not want to expose
    to web script.
	
    Not all methods are exposed.  Only those methods whose parameters and return
    type meets the export criteria will exposed.  Valid types are Objective-C instances
    and scalars.  Other types are not allowed.  Classes may further exclude method
    that they do not want to expose.
    
    Types will be converted to appropriate types in the scripting environment.
    After any KVC coercion occurs the Objective-C types will converted to a type
    appropriate for the script environment.  For JavaScript NSNumber will be
    converted to numbers.  NSString will be converted to strings.  NSArray will
    be mapped to a special read-only array.  NSNull will be converted to null.  
    WebUndefined will be converted to undefined.  WebScriptObjects will be unwrapped.
    Instances of other classes will be wrapped when passed to the script environment
    and unwrapped when returned to Objective-C.  Similar conversion happens in the
    other direction.

    uniqueness of the returned name.  If nil is returned or this
    method is not implemented the default name for the selector will
    be used.  The default name concatenates the components of the
    Objective-C selector name and replaces ':' with '_'.  '_' characters
    are escaped with an additional '$', i.e. '_' becomes "$_".  '$' are
    also escaped, i.e.

    @class WebScriptObject
    @discussion WebScriptObjects are used to wrap script objects passed from
    script environments to Objective-C.  WebScriptObjects cannot be created
    directly.  In normal uses of WebKit, you gain access to the script
    environment using the "windowScriptObject" method on WebView.
    
    The following KVC methods are commonly used to access properties of the
    WebScriptObject:
    
	- (void)setValue:(id)value forKey:(NSString *)key
	- (id)valueForKey:(NSString *)key
	
	As it possible to remove attributes from web script objects the following
	additional method augments the basic KVC methods:
	
	- (void)removeWebScriptKey:(NSString *)name;
	
	Also the sparse array access allowed in web script objects doesn't map well to NSArray, so
	the following methods can be used to access index based properties:
	
	- (id)webScriptValueAtIndex:(unsigned int)index;
	- (void)setWebScriptValueAtIndex:(unsigned int)index value:(id)value;
