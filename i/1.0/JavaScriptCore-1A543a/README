JavaScriptCore is a framework for Mac OS X that takes the cross-platform
KJS library (part of the KDE project), combines it with the PCRE regular
expression library and David M. Gay's floating point conversion
functions, and makes it work with Mac OS X technologies.

This version of JavaScriptCore is based on the KJS library from KDE
3.0.2. The few changes that are specific to JavaScriptCore are marked
with #if APPLE_CHANGES. Other changes to improve performance and web
page compatibility are intended for integration into future versions of
the KJS library.

In order to use the WebCore and JavaScriptCore projects together you
will need to set both projects to use the same build products directory.
To do this:

    1. Click on the JavaScriptCore project item in the Files tab and
       "Show Info" (in the Project menu or use cmd-I).
    2. Select "Place build products for this project in a separate
       location" and type in the shared location (or click the
       "Choose..." button to choose a directory).
    3. Select "Place intermediate build files for this project in the
       same location as the build products".

The repeat these same three steps for WebCore.

Build first JavaScriptCore and then WebCore using either the Project
Builder interface or the "pbxbuild" command from the command line.
