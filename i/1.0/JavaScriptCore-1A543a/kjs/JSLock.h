namespace KJS {

    // to make it safe to use JavaScript on multiple threads, it is
    // important to lock before doing anything that allocates a
    // garbage-collected object or which may affect other shared state
    // such as the protect count hash table. The simplest way to do
    // this is by having a local JSLock object for the scope
    // where the lock must be held. The lock is recursive so nesting
    // is ok.

    // Sometimes it is necessary to temporarily release the lock -
    // since it is recursive you have to actually release all locks
    // held by your thread. This is safe to do if you are executing
    // code that doesn't require the lock, and reacquire the right
    // number of locks at the end. You can do this by constructing a
    // locally scoped JSLock::DropAllLocks object.
