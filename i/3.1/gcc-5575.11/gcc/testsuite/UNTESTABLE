APPLE LOCAL file testsuite

This file lists the markers for local changes that are by their nature
not testable, such as source code tweaks that don't directly affect
compiler behavior.  Every other local change must have at least one
test case.

Note that if a local change fixes a bug that is exposed by an existing
test, then by definition the local change should go into FSF GCC
instead of being listed here.
