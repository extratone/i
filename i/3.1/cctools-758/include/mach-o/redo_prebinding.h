 * If the executable_path parameter for these APIs is not NULL it is used for
 * any dependent library has a path that starts with "@executable_path". Then

 * If the root_dir parameter is not NULL it is prepended to all the rooted

 * and updates relocation entries if necessary.  Unprebound binaries have

 * were found to be bound in the LC_PREBOUND_DYLIB commands.

 * binary, bundles and non-prebound executables and dylibs are acceptable
 * as input.  For these files, the  unprebind operation will zero library 
 * time stamps and version numbers and zero entries in the two-level hints
 * table.  These files will not gain the MH_PREBINDABLE flag.
 * All resulting binaries successfully processed by unprebind() will have
 * the MH_CANONICAL flag.
