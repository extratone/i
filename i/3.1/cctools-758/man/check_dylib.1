.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Check_dylib
is a tool used by Apple's Build and Integration team to perform checks on a
Mach-O dynamic library as part of the build process.  The checks are performed
and
.IR check_dylib (l)
returns the status of the checks as exit values.
.PP
The checks are performed in the following order:
.PP
If the install name of the dynamic library does not start with @executable_path
check the install name of the dynamic library file against the specified
.B \-install_name
argument and if it does not match it exit with a value of 2.
.PP
Check the segment address table specified by
.B \-seg_addr_table
for an entry with the
.I path_name
argument of the
.B \-seg_addr_table_filename
and if one is not found in the table exit with a value of 3.
.PP
Check the dynamic library file's address against the address in the matching
entry in the segment address table specified by
.B \-seg_addr_table
and
.B \-seg_addr_table_filename
and if it does not match exit with a value of 4.
.PP
Check the address of the dynamic library and if it is zero exit with a value
of 5.
.PP
If there is any other errors
.IR check_dylib (l)
exits with a value of 1. If no checks fail then
.IR check_dylib (l)
exits with a value of 0.
