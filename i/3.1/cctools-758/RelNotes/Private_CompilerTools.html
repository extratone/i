<H1>Notes Specific to Release 5.10 (Mac OS X 10.2)</H1>

<H3><FONT SIZE="+1">New Features</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT SIZE="+1">The dynamic linker now supports weak references
and weak dylibs</FONT></H3>

<P>The dynamic linker now supports weak symbol references and weak
dymamic libraries. When creating a binary with the static link editor
if all the symbols referenced from a given dependent dynamic library
are weak references then the library is marked weak. When the binary
is used at execution time and a weak library is missing the dynamic
linker will not cause an error. For all weak symbols that are missing
execution time the dynamic linker uses zero as their address. This
allows a weak symbol's address to be tested for zero at runtime
allowing the code to avoid using the weak symbol when it is missing.
Binaries that use weak references require a dynamic linker from Mac
OS X 10.2 or later.</P>

<P>To indicate a symbol is to be a weak reference the
__attribute((weak_import)) is used on the prototype of the symbol.
When a binary is created by the static link editor normally the all
the undefined symbol references of the object files being linked
should be consistent for each undefined symbol. That is all undefined
symbols should either be weak or non-weak references. If they are not
by default this is treated as an error and can be changed with the
ld(1) <B>-weak_reference_mismatches</B> <I>treatment</I> flag (see
the ld(1) man page for more details).</P>

<P>Weak referenced symbols and weak libraries are only created in the
output by the static link editor, <I>ld</I>(1), when the
MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET environment variable is set to 10.2. If not
a warning is generated when a weak reference would be in the output
and it is not marked weak. Note the default for the
MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET environment variable 10.1 so weak referenced
symbols and weak libraries are not created by default. See the
<I>ld</I>(1) man page for more information on the
MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET environment variable.</P>

<H3><FONT SIZE="+1">redo_prebinding can now slide dylibs</FONT></H3>

<P>The <I>redo_prebinding</I>(1) command and the
<I>redo_prebinding</I>(3) API now can slide dymamic libraries to new
prefered addresses (see the man page for more details).</P>

<H3><FONT SIZE="+1">Support for weak definitions in coalesced
sections</FONT></H3>

<P>There is now support for the <I>.weak_definition</I>
<B>symbol_name</B> assembler directive for symbols in a coalesced
section. This is used by the C++ compiler to support explicit
template instantiation. The assembler symtax for this is:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>.section __TEXT, __template, coalesced<BR>
   .private_extern _template_func<BR>
   .weak_definition _template_func<BR>
   _template_func:<BR>
   li r3,1<BR>
   blr</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>The compiler uses a coalesced section with the
<I>.weak_definition</I> directive for implicitly instantiated
templates. And uses a regualr section (.text, .data, etc) for an
explicit template instantiation.</P>

<P>The static link editor then discards all of the copies of a weak
symbol in a coalesced section if the same symbol is defined in
another section. If there exists only definitions of the weak symbols
in a coalesced section then the one from the first object file being
linked will be used and the others will be discarded.</P>

<P>The support for flat namespace images using weak symbols from a
coalesced section is likely to be buggy as the semantics for it and
lazy binding are not well defined.</P>

   <LI>Added a pre-redo_prebinding checksum to binraries that get
   prebound as a new load command. When a prebound file is created or

   redo_prebinding is run on a binary if the checksum value is zero
   it calculates the checksum and stores that in the load command in
   the output it creates. If when redo_prebinding is run on a binary
   the checksum value is not zero it does not change the checksum

<H3><FONT SIZE="+1">New Features</FONT></H3>

<H3>Automatic initialization of dependent libraries</H3>

<P>The dynamic linker now calls shared library initialization
routines in their dependent order (Radar bug #2441683).</P>

<P>The new function __initialize_Cplusplus() now can be called from a
shared library initialization routines to cause the static C++
objects in the library to be initialized. This them allows shared
library initialization routines to make use of statically initialized
C++ objects. (Radar bug 2441683).</P>

<H3>Update to module termination functions</H3>

<P>The dynamic linker now supports module termination functions for
all types of images (executables, plugins that are not unloaded and
shared libraries). This will allow the C++ compiler to use module
termination functions for destructors instead of atexit(3) so that a
C++ plugin that has a destructor being unloaded does not cause a
crash in atexit(3).</P>

<H3>Update to support for managing the list of globally exported
names</H3>

<P>If you are building a dynamic library you nolonger have to do and
"ld -r" of all of your object files into one object file. The tool
nmedit(1) now can be run on dynamic libraries. Further
__private_extern__ symbols can now be used in modules of dynamic
libraries that also have definitions of global symbols. (Radar bug
2420307 ).</P>

<H3><FONT SIZE="+2">Notes Specific to Release 5.6 (MacOS X
DP4)</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT SIZE="+1">New Features</FONT></H3>

<H3>Support for using shared page table entries on the PowerPC with
dynamic libraries</H3>

<P>For the current generation of PowerPC chips to be able to share
the page table entries among different processes everything mapped
from one 256meg boundary to another 256meg boundary must be the same
in the different processes. This is has not been possible with MacOS
X Mach-O shared libraries as the code and data for each shared
library is staticly linked such that the virtual address of the data
immediately follows the code. And since the data for each process is
different in each process shared page table entries can't be
used.</P>

<P>To make it possible for the current PowerPC chips to be able to
use shared page table entries a new form of MacOS X Mach-O shared
libraries can now be created and used starting with the MacOS X DP4
release. The new form of shared libraries splits the code and data in
to two groups. There is one group for the read-only segments
generated by the compiler system and one group for the read-write
segments.</P>

<P>To create a the new "split" form of shared libraries the new
option <B>-segs_read_only_addr</B> <I>&lt;hex_address&gt;</I> is used
to specify the preferred virtual address of the read-only segments
(where <B>-seg1addr</B> <I>&lt;hex_address&gt;</I> is continued to be
used for the existing "flat" non-split shared libraries). The address
of the read-write segments is specified with
<B>-segs_read_write_addr</B> <I>&lt;hex_address&gt;</I> or defaults
to the address of the read-only segments plus 256meg
(0x10000000).</P>

<P>Until Radar bug #2443215 is fixed these options can't be specified
directly to the compiler driver <I>cc</I>(1). For now the linker
options can be used via the
<B>-Wl,</B><I>-linker_option</I><B>,</B><I>argument</I> compiler
driver option.</P>

<P>When creating a shared library in the split the read-only segments
must not contain any relocation entries. So the used of anything but
the default <B>-read_only_relocs error</B> is not allowed with the
split form of shared libraries.</P>

<P>The kernel starting with the MacOS X DP4 release will reserve two
256meg regions for these split shared libraries to be loaded into
every process that uses the dynamic linker. All shared libraries
having the split form must be placed in these regions. To make it
easier to maintain the preferred virtual addresses of shared
libraries an alternate way of specifying their addresses will be used
by the projects built by Apple's Build and Integration team for MacOS
X. This will involve using a "segment address table" for all dynamic
libraries. This segment address table will be built by Apple's Build
and Integration team and installed in
/AppleInternal/Developer/seg_addr_table. The segment address table
will have entries for each shared library containing its install name
and its <B>-seg1addr</B> or pair of addresses for its
<B>-segs_read_only_addr</B> and <B>-segs_read_write_addr</B>. Then
specifying the address of a shared library will be done with the
option <B>-seg_addr_table</B>
<I>/AppleInternal/Developer/seg_addr_table</I>. Since it may not be
possible to get all project building shared libraries to change to
using the <B>-seg_addr_table</B> option in a timely manner, this can
also be specified via an environment variable. The environment
variable <B>LD_SEG_ADDR_TABLE</B> can be set to the file name of the
segment address table and if so the static link editor will ignore
any <B>-seg1addr</B>, <B>-segs_read_only_addr</B>,
<B>-segs_read_write_addr</B> and <B>-seg_addr_table</B> arguments and
will then use the addresses from the table.</P>

<P>The local tool seg_addr_table(l) is also provided for used by
Apple's Build and Integration team to build and maintain the segment
address table. See the man page for more details.</P>

<H3><FONT SIZE="+2">Notes Specific to Release 5.5 (MacOS X
DP3)</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT SIZE="+1">New Features</FONT></H3>

<H3>Support removing duplicate debugging information from header
files</H3>

<P>The static linker supports removing duplicate debugging
information from header files when this information appears in
multiple object files being linked. This is done with the -Si option
to the static link editor is now the default. To have no symbols
stripped when linking the new -Sn option is now used.</P>

<H3>Support the first phase of "coalesced symbols".</H3>

<H4>I) Goals</H4>

<P>The goal of coalesced symbols is to provide the linker support
needed for the C++ compiler to solve problems with generating code
for the following C++ features:</P>

<UL>
   <LI>implicit template instantiation</LI>
   
   <LI>static variables in inline functions</LI>
   
   <LI>RTTI</LI>
</UL>

<H4>II) The functionality</H4>

<P>A "coalesced symbol" is a true definition of a symbol that may
appear one or more times in the compilation units generated by the
compiler. This will allow the compiler to provide a better user
experience by not forcing the user to tell the compiler exactly where
to output the definition of the symbol, which is problematic in
implementing some of the above C++ features.</P>

<P>The static link editor will allow multiple definitions of a
"coalesced symbol" without any warnings or errors. The static link
editor will output only one instance of each "coalesced symbol" using
the first instance it encounters in the object files being linked.
The static link editor will always output an instance of a "coalesced
symbol" if it appears in the object files being linked even if it
also appears in the dynamic libraries being referenced.</P>

<P>The dynamic link editor will then do its relocation such that only
one instance of each "coalesced symbol" is used throughout the
program.</P>

<H4>III) The implementation</H4>

<P>A Mach-O new section type, "coalesced", has been be added to the
compiler tools. A "coalesced symbol" will simply be a symbol defined
in a section with the type "coalesced". The assembler has been
changed to accept the new section type identifier "coalesced".</P>

<P>For example to create a "coalesced symbol" named _foo as a 4-byte
integer initialized to one, the following assembly code could be
used:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>.section __DATA, __coalesced, coalesced<BR>
   .globl _foo<BR>
   _foo: .long 1</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>An example of a template function created as a "coalesced symbol"
could use the following assembly code:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>.section __TEXT, __template, coalesced,
   pure_instructions<BR>
   .globl _template_func<BR>
   _template_func:<BR>
   li r3,1<BR>
   blr</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Once the compiler group establishes conventional sections for
various C++ "coalesced symbols" we will add built-in assembler
section directives like: .template, .coalesced_data, .rtti_data as
equivalents for the above section directives.</P>

<P>A new section type constant, S_COALESCED, has been added to the
header file, &lt;mach-o/loader.h&gt; which describes the Mach-O
object file format. In the object files created by the assembler
"coalesced" section types have this constant in the flags field of
the section header.</P>

<P>The static and dynamic linker look at the section type to
determine that the symbol is a "coalesced symbol" and allow multiple
definitions of "coalesced symbols".</P>

<P>The static link editor effectively divides up a "coalesced
section" on the boundaries of the symbols in that section,
associating the bytes of the section after each symbol with the
preceding symbol. An object file is considered malformed if a
"coalesced section" did not have a symbol at the first address of the
section.</P>

<P>The symbolic debugging symbol table entries, STABS, for a given
coalesced symbol must be preceded by the new begin nsect symbol stab
(N_BNSYM) and an end with the new end nsect symbol stab (N_ENSYM).
These stabs must be at the start and end of the given coalesced
symbol.</P>

<H4>IV) The restrictions</H4>

<P>In order to allow the dynamic linker to make sure only one
instance of of each "coalesced symbol" is used throughout the
program, all references to "coalesced symbols" via instructions must
be done indirectly through symbol stubs (for calls) or through
non-lazy pointers. The static link editor enforces this restriction
by checking that there are no direct relocation entries to "coalesced
symbol" using section difference relocation entries, and if any are
found it will considered the object file malformed. This is must be
true even if the coalesced symbol is defined in the same compilation
unit where references are also being made.</P>

<P>The assembler and static link editor have also been changed so
that if a global symbol is referenced in a "coalesced section" that
is defined, an external relocation entry is used instead of a local
relocation entry.</P>

<P>Routines generated for C++ static initializers which are
initializing a "coalesced symbol" must also be a "coalesced symbol".
They do require one code generation change to make it possible that
they could be called more than once and only do the initializing the
first time. This is required so they dynamic linker does not need to
keep track of the initializers for each "coalesced symbol". It will
further require the existing implementation in the GNU compiler to
change slightly. Currently the GNU compiler generates one
initializers function for all C++ static initializers in the
compilation unit. This will have to change so that a separate
function would be created for initializing a "coalesced symbol".</P>

<H3>Lazy binding of symbols vs binding all symbols at launch
time</H3>

<P>For MacOS X the dynamic linker defaults to lazy binding. That is,
symbols are linked into the program as they are needed. For function
calls this usually happens when the function is called the first
time. For data references this happens before any code that can
reference the data is executed. This generally reduces the time it
takes to start execution of the program by delaying the binding and
initialization of symbols.</P>

<P>With lazy binding, the linking of symbols into the program happens
in a distributed fashion as opposed to binding all symbols when the
program is launched. A program or plugin may be built with the
-bind_at_load option to force all symbols to be bound when the
program is launched or when the plugin is loaded.</P>

<P>There can be rare cases where lazy binding and binding at launch
can produce different results. These cases can only occur when a
program is using more than one library that defines the same symbol,
which is not generally a common occurrence. For example a program
could be linked against both a debug and non-debug version of the
same library. Even in this case, usually both libraries define all
the same symbols, so the symbols the program ends up using are those
from the first library listed on the program's link line. However if
the two libraries do not define the same symbols organized in the
same way, that's when these rare cases where lazy binding and binding
at launch can produce different results.</P>

<P>To understand these cases one needs to understand what is meant by
"how a library's symbols are organized" and how that effects linking.
The symbols of a library are organized into modules. Library modules
are the object files that were used to build the library and are
typically the created from compiling one source file. However the
library implementor may combine a number of compiled source files for
a library subsystem into a larger object file that is then used to
build the library. The library implementor will do this when the
interface symbols that make up a subsystem share some private or
internal data, such that all the interface symbols for that subsystem
must be used together for the subsystem to work correctly. Examples
might include a malloc subsystem, a pthreads subsystem, or data base
subsystem. These subsystems may have many interface symbols that must
be used together as they are sharing data among the interfaces. And
the interface symbols would not work correctly if some symbols were
used from one implementation and some from another. Rather than just
let the program work incorrectly in these cases, when the static or
dynamic linker detects these cases they will generate a multiply
defined symbol error. Indicating that parts of more than one
implementation of a subsystem are trying to be used in the same
program.</P>

<P>Now how library modules effects linking is, that if a symbol is
needed to resolve an undefined reference, the first library module in
the list of libraries that has a definition is used. Then not only is
the symbol that resolves the undefined reference used from the
library module but all symbols in that same library module are then
used.</P>

<P>So when more than one library that defines the same symbol is
used, the static and dynamic linkers must select a definition for the
symbol to be used from one of the libraries. As stated above, the
first library module in the list of libraries that has a definition
is used. Then all the symbols from that library module are then used.
So which library modules get used by a program is a function of which
undefined references must be resolved, the order they are resolved
and which symbols are defined in each library module.</P>

<P>For lazy binding and binding at launch the list of undefined
references that must be resolved are typically different. For lazy
binding this usually is a subset of the undefined symbols that a
program uses. So if more than one library is used by the program that
defines the same global symbols but are organized into different
library modules, it is possible that depending on which undefined
references are need to be resolved that different library modules
maybe selected. In the case of lazy binding a first subset of the
symbols may select a library module from one library and a second
subset of symbols may select a library module from a different
library. This may lead to multiply defined symbol errors. Or may lead
to symbols being used from different implementations of a
subsystem.</P>

<P>But in the common case, if no two libraries that are used by a
program define the same symbols there is not a difference in lazy
binding and binding at launch. Further if there is more than one
library that defines the same symbols and the are organized into the
same library modules again there is no difference in lazy binding and
binding at launch. For MacOS X post PR2, the static link editor, now
detects cases where lazy binding and binding at launch could produce
different results, and issues a warning. The warning suggests the use
of the -bind_at_load option. Also for MacOS X post PR2, the dynamic
linker ensures that symbols in a program built with the -bind_at_load
option, are the same as the static link editor determined would be
used. See Radar bug #2378121.</P>

<H3><FONT SIZE="+2">Notes Specific to Release 5.4 (MacOS X
PR2)</FONT>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3><FONT SIZE="+1">New Features</FONT></H3>

<P>Dynamic shared libraries now can have a dynamic shared library
initialization routine (Radar bug #2367584). This routine is
specified to libtool(1) with the new "-init <I>symbol_name</I>"
argument. The library initialization routine is called before any
symbol is used from the library including C++ static initializers
(and #pragma CALL_ON_MODULE_BIND routines). If cc(1) -dynamiclib is
used instead of libtool(1), you may need to pass the argument with
-Wl,-init, <I>symbol_name </I>until Radar bug #2367569 is fixed. Also
gdb(1) will not read the symbols of dynamic shared libraries with
library initialization routine due to Radar bug #2367576.</P>

<P>The dynamic linker now supports shared library install names that
start with "@executable_path/" and substitutes the directory path of
the executable for "@executable_path/"when locating the library. This
requires a kernel from Beaker2H3 or later. Without that kernel, this
feature can only be used if argv&#91;0&#93; is in fact the name of
the executable and it is an absolute path or relative to the current
directory (contains at a '/' in the argv&#91;0&#93; string). The
kernel in Beaker2H3 was extended to pass the first argument to exec()
to the entry point interface, and having that kernel this feature can
be used no matter what argv&#91;0&#93; is.</P>

<P>The NSLinkModule() API now has an option to cause it to return
when there is an error loading the module and a new API
NSLinkEditError() to get the error information. To use this the
constant NSLINKMODULE_OPTION_RETURN_ON_ERROR needs to be or'ed into
the options parameter to NSLinkModule(). Then if NSLinkModule()
returns NULL the error information can be retrieved with
NSLinkEditError().</P>

<P>The NSLINKMODULE_OPTION_RETURN_ON_ERROR option is an alternative
method to the existing dyld error handling which fits better with a
plugin model. With the NSLINKMODULE_OPTION_RETURN_ON_ERROR option,
the model for handling errors is to simply return without any changes
to the program. To support this model of error handling a new API has
been added to allow the programmer to get the error information that
the dyld error handlers would normally have gotten. The API is
similar to the dyld linkEdit error handler except that all the
parameters are passed as pointers to be filled in.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>extern void NSLinkEditError(<BR>
   NSLinkEditErrors *c,<BR>
   int *errorNumber,<BR>
   const char **fileName,<BR>
   const char **errorString);</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>The last two parameters return pointers to static buffers
allocated in the dynamic linker which get reused on subsequent calls
to NSLinkEditError(). The NSLinkEditErrors enum has been extended to
include NSLinkEditUndefinedError and
NSLinkEditMultiplyDefinedError.</P>

   is calling signal(2) which causes the executable containing the
   signal handler to be fully bound. The fix for Radar bug #2378121
   in this case caused a big slow down in the case of fully
   binding.</LI>

<H3><FONT SIZE="+2">Notes Specific to Release 5.3 (MacOS X
PR1)</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT SIZE="+1">New Features</FONT></H3>

<P>The NSLinkModule() API now can create private modules and the new
API NSLookupSymbolInModule() allows symbols to be looked up in a
private module. To do this the interface to NSLinkModule() has change
in a compatible way from:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>extern NSModule NSLinkModule(<BR>
   NSObjectFileImage objectFileImage,<BR>
   const char *moduleName,<BR>
   enum bool bindNow);</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>to:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>extern NSModule NSLinkModule(<BR>
   NSObjectFileImage objectFileImage,<BR>
   const char *moduleName,<BR>
   unsigned long options);</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>with the options as follows:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>#define NSLINKMODULE_OPTION_NONE 0x0<BR>
   #define NSLINKMODULE_OPTION_BINDNOW 0x1<BR>
   #define NSLINKMODULE_OPTION_PRIVATE 0x2</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>The first two are the same as bindNow with a value of FALSE and
TRUE. The private options is what is used to load a private module.
The API for getting to the symbols of a NSModule that has been
privately linked is:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>extern NSSymbol NSLookupSymbolInModule(<BR>
   NSModule module,<BR>
   const char *symbolName);</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Then to get the address of the returned NSSymbol, the existing
NSAddressOfSymbol() API can be used.</P>

<P>The NSUnLinkModule() API is now implemented with enough
functionality to make Apache work (Radar bug #2262020). This has been
confirmed by Wilfredo Sanchez the owner of the Apache project. It
currently has the following limitations (to be fixed in future
releases):</P>

<UL>
   <LI>only works for plugins (can only be called on modules that
   were returned by NSLinkModule).</LI>
   
   <LI>C++ plugins that have static destructor can't be unloaded. The
   program will crash in atexit(3) when the unlinked destructor is
   attempted to be called.</LI>
   
   <LI>Objective-C plugins should not be unloaded. The Objective-C
   runtime has not been updated to know about unloading and the
   result is very likely to crash the program.</LI>
   
   <LI>The debugger has not been update to know about unloading and
   trying to debug a program that unloads it's plugins may confuse or
   crash the debugger.</LI>
</UL>

<P>The interface to NSUnLinkModule has change in a compatible way
from:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>extern enum bool NSUnLinkModule(<BR>
   NSModule module,<BR>
   enum bool keepMemoryMapped);</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>to:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>extern enum bool NSUnLinkModule(<BR>
   NSModule module,<BR>
   int options);</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>where the options are:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>#define NSUNLINKMODULE_OPTION_NONE 0x0<BR>
   #define NSUNLINKMODULE_OPTION_KEEP_MEMORY_MAPPED 0x1<BR>
   #define NSUNLINKMODULE_OPTION_RESET_LAZY_REFERENCES 0x2</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>The first two are the same as keepMemoryMapped with a value of
FALSE and TRUE. The reset lazy references allows unloaded modules
with only call sites to undefined functions (direct calls not calls
through pointers) to be allowed when unloading and not causing an
undefined symbol error. Then if a subsequent module is loaded that
defines symbols that were previously undefined, the call sites will
then use the new definitions. This is currently only implemented for
PowerPC. For intel it prints a message and exits even if the symbol
gets redefined. This will be fixed for intel in a future release.</P>

<P>Support for module termination functions has been added for
plugins (only). Currently the compiler pragma CALL_ON_UNLOAD (as well
as CALL_ON_LOAD) is not yet implemented to use this feature as
intended. A work around can be done in place of having the
pragma:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>void my_term(void)<BR>
   {<BR>
   /* do module termination */<BR>
   }<BR>
   /* #pragma CALL_ON_UNLOAD my_term */<BR>
   #pragma SECTION data ".section __DATA, __mod_term_func,
   mod_init_funcs"<BR>
   static void (*dummy)(void) = my_term;<BR>
   #pragma SECTION data</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>The cctools-294 project has an implementation of the FreeBSD
dlopen() interfaces. The header file dlfcn.h and the library libdl.a
are NOT installed or built by the project by default. This is to
avoid automatic configure scripts of projects from using this stuff
in release builds before it can be tested by project owners. If an
when a future version of cctools has a working set of dlopen()
interfaces it will install the header file dlfcn.h and build the
library code by default. Most likely the library code will be in
included in System framework and not a separate libdl.a. At that time
a man page will installed. Currently there is no MacOS X Server
version of the man page and the FreeBSD version must be
consulted.</P>

<P>There is support for managing the list of globally exported names
in cctools that is generally not well known. For managing the list of
globally exported names with a list of global symbols that is
maintained by the developer the existing tools nmedit(l) and strip(1)
can be used. The approach is to build the project normally with full
debugging symbols. Then nmedit(1) is run on that with the list of
exported symbols and the result is placed in the standard $(SYMROOT).
nmedit(1) turns all other global symbols not listed in the file into
statics. That resulting file still has all the debugging symbols and
can be fully symbolically debugged. Then when the file is copied from
the $(SYMROOT) to the $(DSTROOT) in the install process, it is
strip(1)'ed with the usual -S (or other options) to remove debugging
symbols. This leaves the static symbols as well as the global symbols
so that back traces will still have the symbol names. Assuming the
list of symbols is in the file save_syms, the example commands would
be:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>nmedit -s save_syms $(OBJROOT)/hello -o
   $(SYMROOT)/hello<BR>
   strip -S $(SYMROOT)/hello -o $(DSTROOT)/hello</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>If you are building a dynamic library you may also have to do and
"ld -r" of all of your object files into one object file. You can
also manage the list of globally exported names in your project with
nmedit(1) or strip(1).</P>

<P>In the future there will also be compiler support to use the
external/internal #pragmas that CFM uses. Today you can use the key
word __private_extern__ to get this functionality.</P>

<P>As of cctools-292, the cctools project has been updated to be able
to built with the egcs compiler with no warnings from source code of
the project (the header files in Beaker1I2 still produce
warnings).</P>

<P>The cctools-294 project has been ported and tested on MacOS X
using Beaker1L. To build cctools-294 for MacOS X, first the SDK has
to be installed on a PowerPC machine with
/System/Administration/Installer.app into /Local/Public/MacOSX. Then
the commands to build it are:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE># ~rc/bin/buildit -release Beaker cctools-293 RC_OS=macos</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Only the profileServer is left to be ported. It is currently not
built for MacOS X when RC_OS=macos.</P>

   <LI>Fixed a bug in the static link editor where the module name of
   dynamic shared library was set wrong. This happened when creating
   a dynamic shared library from an archive library member that had a
   long name (using the 4.4bsd archive extened format 1). The module
   name dynamic shared library would end up like "#1/20" rather than
   its correct name. Radar bug #2239283.</LI>
   
   <LI>Fixed a bug in strip(1) when stripping a dynamic shared
   library. This happened when the stripping was removing a symbol
   defined in one module and referenced in other modules. The
   library's table of contents was not correctly updated to reflect
   this symbol was no longer defined. This would then cause the
   static link editor to think the library was malformed as a module
   was loaded did not define a symbol as expected in the table of
   contents. Radar bug #2239280.</LI>

   <LI>The VMX opcodes have been added to the Rhapsody PowerPC
   assembler. Radar bug #2237908.</LI>
   
   <LI>Fixed a bug that caused NSModuleForSymbol() to return NULL
   when called in a module initializer routine on a symbol in that
   module. Radar bug #2238301.</LI>
   
   <LI>Removed the -arch i586SX and added the following intel x86
   specific subtype archs: pentium, pentpro, pentIIm3 and pentIIm5.
   Radar bug #2231830.</LI>
   
   <LI>Fixed a bug in dyld that used the wrong segment's address for
   executable's base relocation address. It was using the segment
   with the lowest address not the first segment's address. Radar bug
   #2237029.</LI>
   
   <LI>Changed the way the static link editor assigns segment address
   of segments that were not specified on the command line.
   Previously the static link editor often picked overlapping
   addresses for these segments and the link would then fail. Now the
   static link editor assigns segment address at the next available
   address after the first segment that doesn't overlap with other
   segments. So if some segments are assigned address the first
   segment must also be assigned, which can be done via -seg1addr or
   by name with -segaddr. Radar bug #2237029.</LI>
   
   <LI>A missing test was added to the static link editor. This is to
   prevent it from producing an executable that is prebound which
   would crash when launched and prebinding was disabled. This
   happens when too much address space is spanned and the first
   segment is more than 24-bits away from a prebound lazy pointer.
   This occurred with BlueBox. Radar bug #2237029.</LI>
   
   <LI>Fixed a bug in the dyld debug library code the caused it to
   crash (usually the debugger). This would tend to happen on
   executables being debugged that did not have it headers linked at
   the default address. This occurred with BlueBox. Radar bug
   #2236161.</LI>
   
   <LI>Added the <I>-R filename</I> options to strip(1) and
   nmedit(l). This specifies a list of specific symbols to be removed

   filename syntax to allow white space around symbol names and
   comment lines starting with a '#'. Radar bug #2235926.</LI>

   <LI>Changed all of the compiler tools to support the 4.4bsd
   archive extened format 1. The tools ranlib(1) and libtool(1) now
   take the -L option to produce archives using the extended format
   and the -T option to truncate names. The default is -L. Radar bug
   #1670513.</LI>
   
   <LI>The error message printed in dyld for the case when the path
   name of a dynamic library turns out to be a path name of a
   directory has been changed. Previously it just printed can't
   map_fd the path name. It now prints the file name is not a regular
   file. Radar bug #2227477.</LI>
   
   <LI>The processing of the environment variables for dyld paths has
   been changed to ignore paths with no characters in them. This led
   to confusion when the directory layout was changed to have a
   directory named /System and then the System framework would be
   searched as /System if a path with no characters in it was in
   DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH. Radar bug #2227589.</LI>

   in /usr/bin rather than in /bin.</LI>
   
   <LI>Added support for the ppc architecture to
   redo_prebinding(1).</LI>
   
   <LI>Fixed a bug in ld(1) when prebinding and segments in the
   output file overlap dependent libraries. In this case the output
   gets marked as prebound even though a message is printed that says
   it was disabled. This would cause redo_prebinding(1) to fail on it
   because of overlapping segments.</LI>
   
   <LI>Fixed a bug in ld(1) when prebinding with -i options. The
   indirect symbols being defined with -i options were being turned
   into prebound undefined symbols. Then after the binary was
   strip(1)'ed redo_prebinding(1) would fail on it because of
   undefined symbols.</LI>
   
   <LI>Fixed a bug in ld(1) when doing prebound builds in Slick build
   envorinment with $NEXT_ROOT set. It was recording the dynamic
   libraries name with $NEXT_ROOT prepened to it in LC_PREBOUND_DYLIB
   load commands.</LI>
   
   <LI>Fixed a bug where the ouput of nm(1) -n was not sorted
   correctly.</LI>
   
   <LI>Fixed a potentinal bug in dyld if a very long symbol name was
   to be printed as part of an error message it could have crashed
   the program.</LI>
</UL>

<H5><FONT SIZE="+1">Changes since the last release (cctools-247 for
the 5.1 Rhapsody DR2 release)</FONT></H5>

<UL>
   <LI>Changed the gmon.out format gprof(1) understands to be in sync
   with the 4.4bsd format. The header file &lt;mach-o/gmon.h&gt; is
   no longer installed and the 4.4bsd file in &lt;sys/gmon.h&gt; with
   Rhapsody updates is now used.</LI>
   
   <LI>Fixed a bug that would cause programs to segfault if dyld had
   to relocate itself because the executable overlapped with dyld's
   prefered address.</LI>
</UL>

<H5><FONT SIZE="+1">Changes since the last release (cctools-246 for
the 5.0 Rhapsody DR1 release)</FONT></H5>

<UL>
   <LI>The project source tree has been converted to build natively
   on Rhapsody.</LI>
   
   <LI>The binaries are now installed in the correct places for a
   4.4BSD system. There are nolonger any symbolic links to other
   locations. Radar bugs #1673496, #1680747 and #1682569.</LI>
   
   <LI>The command ar(1) was changed to have the -T options on by
   default. This causes archive member names to be truncated and does
   not use the extend format for long names which the compiler tools
   does not yet understand. The new option -L causes the extend
   format to be used. The hope is the compiler tools will understand
   the extened format for the Rhapsody Unified release. Radar bug
   #1670513.</LI>
   
   <LI>Removed the comment allowing the moduleName parameter of
   NSLinkModule() in &lt;mach-o/dyld.h&gt; to be NULL. Radar bug
   #1670835.</LI>

DR1)</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT SIZE="+1">New Features</FONT></H3>

<P>There is only one new feature for the 5.0 release:</P>

<UL>
   <LI>The tools now use -arch ppc for the PowerPC architecture . The
   tools have been brought up the 603, 603e, 604 and 604e PowerPC
   from the 601. Support for dynamic shared libraries has been
   added.</LI>
</UL>

<H3>The current state of the dynamic shared library port to the
PowerPC</H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE>As of cctools-246 the all the tools are working or
   ported. This includes the assembler, the static linker, otool
   (including it's PowerPC disassembler), the dynamic linker and the
   various object tools like nm, size, etc. The PowerPC assembler as
   of the current release is now complete for the Rhapsody Developer
   release. It now supports all of the PowerPC extended mnemonics and
   all features of the 603, 603e, 604 and 604e PowerPC architecture.</BLOCKQUOTE>

   <LI>The jbsr pseudo instruction assembles to a bl instruction
   targeted at L1. It also generates a PPC_RELOC_JBSR relocation
   entry for the symbol _foo. Then when the linker creates a
   non-relocatable output file it will change the target of the bl
   instruction to _foo if the bl instruction's displacement will
   reach. Else it will leave the bl instruction targeted at L1.
   <I>otool</I>(1) understands how to disassemble these pseudo
   instructions.</LI>
   
   <LI>Fixed a bug in both the static and the dynamic link editors
   where it was not correctly checking for relocation overflow for
   PPC_RELOC_BR24 relocation types (used with bl instructions). The
   checking was off by the high bit as the displacement is
   signed.</LI>
   
   <LI>The cctools project has been unencumbered (for Grail,
   RC_OS=teflon). The programs ar(1) and file(1) are now ported
   OpenBSD versions. They should work the same but beware they are
   completely different sources.</LI>
   
   <LI>Added the following extended mnemonics to the PowerPC
   assembler:

<UL>
   <LI>The changed the assembler in cctools-228 was wrong. It

<H5><FONT SIZE="+1">Changes since the last release (cctools-227 for

</UL>

<H5><FONT SIZE="+1">Changes since the last release (cctools-225 for
the 5.0 Rhapsody DR1 release)</FONT></H5>

<UL>
   <LI>Added ppc604 to the arch table for a specific architecture as
   this is what the Kernel is returning on the Power Mac 8500. This
   was causing code that supported loading bundles to fail (this is
   library code in System framework, thus a new System framework
   needs to be built and used to see this fix).</LI>
   
   <LI>Fixed a bug in the dynamic link editor where it was not
   correctly calculating the immediate of a HA16 reloc by checking
   the 0x8000 bit of the other half. This was causing address to be
   off by 0x10000.</LI>
   
   <LI>Fixed a bug in the dynamic link editor when the $HOME
   environment variable was not set. (the case for the single user
   prompt on PowerPC). This was causing bus errors when a dynamic
   library was not found.</LI>
</UL>

<H5><FONT SIZE="+1">Changes since the last release (cctools-224 for
the 5.0 Rhapsody DR1 release)</FONT></H5>

<UL>
   <LI>Fixed a bug in the static link editor where the __PAGEZERO
   segment was not being created for PowerPC (left over from NRW when
   executables started at high addresses and the kernel was at
   zero).</LI>
   
   <LI>Changed the static link editor to ignore -seg1addr (also known
   as -image_base) for dynamic libraries greater than 0x4000000 for
   PowerPC. This will allow static code gen to be used with
   Frameworks.</LI>
   
   <LI>Changes since the last release (cctools-223 for the 5.0
   Rhapsody release)</LI>
   
   <LI>Changed the source of cctools-224 to define NO_INDR_LIBC if
   __TEFLON__ is defined so it will build with SDK2 which is not
   using <I>indr</I>(l). This will allow cctools-224 to built for the
   Grail RC target.</LI>
   
   <LI>Fixed a bug in the static link editor when defining common
   symbols when a common section exists in the input .o files which
   has an alignment less than the alignment needed for the common
   symbols being defined by the link editor did not get aligned
   correctly.</LI>
   
   <LI>Fixed <I>libtool</I>(1) running on Teflon so it doesn't always
   report "internal link edit command failed". The link actually
   worked but the checking of the return code for Teflon was
   wrong.</LI>
   
   <LI>Fixed <I>as</I>(1) running on Teflon so it doesn't always exit
   non-zero when it runs the target assembler (/lib/arch/as). The
   assembly actually worked but the checking of the return code for
   Teflon was wrong.</LI>
   
   <LI>The other thread states for PowerPC are now printed by otool
   (useful for core files).</LI>
   
   <LI>Added the PowerPC simplified mnemonics crset, crclr and mtcr
   to the assembler.</LI>
   
   <LI>Added the include file &lt;mach-o/ranlib.h&gt; to the cctools
   project from &lt;bsd/ranlib.h&gt; and changed <I>off_t</I> type to
   <I>unsigned long</I> because <I>off_t</I> on Teflon is 64 bits
   which would break compatibility with existing libraries.</LI>
   
   <LI>Added the header files &lt;mach-o/sparc/swap.h&gt;and
   &lt;mach-o/ppc/swap.h&gt; which get installed in the System
   Framework to be shipped. This and the added library code allows
   swapping of thread states.</LI>
   
   <LI>Added the header files &lt;mach-o/i860/swap.h&gt;and
   &lt;mach-o/m88k/swap.h&gt; which get installed locally and not
   shipped. The code was not added to the System Framework.</LI>
   
   <LI>Changed the cctools package to install
   &lt;mach-o/ppc/reloc.h&gt; with the exported headers. And to
   install &lt;mach-o/hppa/reloc.h&gt; with the local headers.</LI>
   
   <LI>Changed of the ppc subtypes to match the kernel. Only the 601
   and 603 types are currently used by the assembler. The types
   currently in use are as follows:

   </LI>
   
   <LI>The -arch flags for the 601 and 603 are -arch ppc601 and -arch
   ppc603. Others will be defined as needed.</LI>
   
   <LI>Updated the NXFindBestFatArch(3) and NXCombineCpuSubtypes(3)

   <LI>Fixed a bug in the link editor <I>ld</I>(1) for PowerPC HA16
   relocation types when bit 15 was set in the other half of the
   immediate stored in the relocation entry. This resulted in bad
   code. This bug was found when bringing up driverkit and is needed
   for anyone doing development on driverkit for PowerPC.</LI>
   
   <LI>Fixed a bug in the link editor <I>ld</I>(1) where it generated
   an error message for the lazy symbol pointer section in crt1.o for
   PowerPC which it shouldn't have. This bug was found bring up
   -dynamic code gen for PowerPC and is needed for anyone using
   -dynamic code gen for PowerPC.</LI>
   
   <LI>Incorporated many changes to allow cctools-222 to build for
   PowerPC &amp; Intel with Teflon SDK2.</LI>
</UL>

<H5><FONT SIZE="+1">Changes since the last release (cctools-220 for
the 5.0 Rhapsody DR1 release)</FONT></H5>

<UL>
   <LI>The thread status for the PowerPC has changed to match the
   kernel. This makes all previous executables incompatible. The old
   <I>otool</I>(1) will no longer work on PowerPC executables because
   of this change. All executables should be relinked.</LI>
</UL>

<H5><FONT SIZE="+1">Changes since the last release (cctools-219 for
the 5.0 Rhapsody DR1 release)</FONT></H5>

<UL>
   <LI>Fixed a bug in the link editor <I>ld</I>(1)where $NEXT_ROOT
   did not get prefixed to depenendent dynamic libraries.</LI>
</UL>

<H5><FONT SIZE="+1">Changes since the last release (cctools-218 for
the 5.0 Rhapsody DR1 release)</FONT></H5>

<UL>
   <LI>Added searching fallback paths when dynamic libraries can't be
   found. The two paths are in the environment variables
   DYLD_FALLBACK_FRAMEWORK_PATH and DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH. If
   these are not set they default to
   $(HOME)/Library/Frameworks:/LocalLibrary/Frameworks:/NextLibrary/Frameworks
   and $(HOME)/lib:/usr/local/lib:/lib:/usr/lib (bug #69135).</LI>
   
   <LI>Changed the static linker to pad pure instruction sections of
   i386 outputs with nop's (bug #77806).</LI>
   
   <LI>Added .section_align <I>align_value</I> to be allowed in
   section order files. This causes the symbol following it to be
   aligned on a 2^<I>align_value</I> byte boundary (bug #77807).</LI>
</UL>

<H5><FONT SIZE="+1">Changes since the last release (cctools-217 for
the 5.0 Rhapsody DR1 release)</FONT></H5>

<UL>
   <LI>Changed the cctools project to build with gnumake.</LI>
   
   <LI>Updated the locking code and the cache management code in the
   dynamic linker for the PowerPC with suggestions from the ppc
   bringup team.</LI>
</UL>

<H5><FONT SIZE="+1">Changes since the last release (cctools-216 for

</UL>

<H5><FONT SIZE="+1">Changes since the last release (cctools-215 for
the 5.0 Rhapsody DR1 release)</FONT></H5>

<UL>
   <LI>Changed the standard symbol stubs for the PowerPC to take
   advantage of the super scaler nature of the 603 and 604. See the
   updated Dynamic Shared Libraries Detailed Design Document for the
   details.</LI>
</UL>

<H5><FONT SIZE="+1">Changes since the last release (cctools-214 for
the 5.0 Rhapsody DR1 release)</FONT></H5>

<UL>
   <LI>Made the cctools-215 project build (except for linking dyld
   and otool) under the Teflon SDK.</LI>
   
   <LI>Fixed the PowerPC assembler to use the correct opcodes for
   mftb and mftbu and updated otool's disassembly.</LI>
   
   <LI>Added the support in the static link editor to understand
   thePowerPC position-independent relocation entries (section
   difference). This allows PowerPC dynamic shared libraries and
   executables that use them to be built (Note as stated above there
   is not yet a compiler that supports -dynamic for -arch ppc, and
   there is no dynamic linker yet for PowerPC).</LI>
   
   <LI>Added the support in the PowerPC assembler for the standard
   symbol stubs.</LI>
</UL>

<H5><FONT SIZE="+1">Changes since the last release (cctools-213 for
the 5.0 Rhapsody DR1 release)</FONT></H5>

<UL>
   <LI>Added the support in the PowerPC assembler for
   position-independent relocation entries (section difference). As
   well as support in otool for printing them and dissassembling with
   them.</LI>
   
   <LI>Updated the Detailed Design Document with the first cut at the
   code generation for -dynamic for the PowerPC. This is just a first
   pass to allow getting the assember and otool in place so that the
   compiler work can start.</LI>
   
   <LI>Fixed a bug in the PowerPC assembler where it treated the
   comment character ';' (semicolon) as a statement separator.</LI>
   
   <LI>Fixed the PowerPC assembler to allow -arch m98k if passed to
   it.</LI>
</UL>

<H5><FONT SIZE="+1">Changes since the last release (cctools-212 for
the 5.0 Rhapsody DR1 release)</FONT></H5>

<UL>
   <LI>The header files for mach-o subdirectory and the library files
   were added to the cctools project taken from the libc_macho
   project.</LI>
   
   <LI>Fixed the typo in the <I>ld</I>(1) warning message for bug
   #77070.</LI>
   
   <LI>Fixed a bug in <I>ld</I>(1) that was causing prebinding not to
   happen if a private extern had the same name as a global function
   in a dependent library (this can occur because -lcc_dynamic is
   being linked in).</LI>
   
   <LI>Fixed the PowerPC's assembler manual for compare instructions
   to have a 0 not a 1 for the 32-bit version not the 64-bit version.
   For example cmp 0,1,RA,RB was changed to cmp 0,0,RA,RB.</LI>
   
   <LI>Changed <I>libtool</I>(1) to ignore the -pg flag.</LI>
   
   <LI>Added the not rA,rT and not. rA,rT instructions.</LI>
</UL>

<H5><FONT SIZE="+1">Changes since the last release (cctools-211 for
the 5.0 Rhapsody DR1 release)</FONT></H5>

<UL>
   <LI>Fixed a bug in the link editor <I>ld</I>(1)where $NEXT_ROOT
   did not prefix standard framework paths. Also fixed -Z to not use
   standard framework paths.</LI>
   
   <LI>Changed the following instructions to the correct PowerPC
   mnemonics:

   </P></LI>
   
   <LI>Also corrected the opcodes for slbie and slbia
   instructions.</LI>
   
   <LI>The bug in the assembler that causes it exits with a zero
   status and create an output file if it can't open the input file
   has been fixed.</LI>
   
   <LI>The .flag_reg <I>num</I> and .noflag_reg <I>num</I> ppc
   directives were added to the assembler to allow warnings to be
   generated for specific register uses.</LI>
   
   <LI>The -no_ppc601 flag and the .no_ppc601 directive were added to
   the assembler to warn of 601 uses.</LI>
   
   <LI>The 603 instructions tlbld rB and tlbli rB were added to the
   assembler.</LI>
   
   <LI>The missing 601 instruction clcs rD,rA was added to the
   assembler.</LI>
   
   <LI>Use of instructions specific to the 601 and 603 now cause the
   assembler to mark the resulting object file with the specific
   cpusubtype. Note the assembler is currently not complete with
   respect to instructions for the specfic cpusubtypes. All of the
   ppc subtypes have been added to cctools-212's version of
   &lt;mach/machine.h&gt; but only the 601 and 603 types are
   currently used. The types are as follows:

   <LI>The NRW compiler mnemonics will continue to work as long as
   the NRW compiler is in use. Assembly code should be converted to

   r1,0x8000. This is now consistant with addis r1,0,0x8000.</LI>
   
   <LI>The tools now use -arch ppc for the PowerPC architecture
