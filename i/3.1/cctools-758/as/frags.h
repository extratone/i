/*
 * A code fragment (frag) is some known number of chars, followed by some
 * unknown number of chars. Typically the unknown number of chars is an
 * instruction address whose size is yet unknown. We always know the greatest
 * possible size the unknown number of chars may become, and reserve that
 * much room at the end of the frag.
 * Once created, frags do not change address during assembly.
 * We chain the frags in (a) forward-linked list(s). The object-file address
 * of the 1st char of a frag is generally not known until after relax().
 * Many things at assembly time describe an address by {object-file-address
 * of a particular frag}+offset.

 BUG: it may be smarter to have a single pointer off to various different
notes for different frag kinds. See how code pans out.
