# This harness is for testing builtin support.  Each test has two files:
#
#    - foo.c defines the main testing function, main_test().
#    - foo-lib.c implements the library functions that foo.c is testing.
#
# The functions in foo-lib.c will often want to abort on certain inputs.
# They can use the global variable inside_main to see whether they are
# being called from the test program or part of the common runtime.
#
# In many cases, the library functions will behave as normal at -O0
# and abort when optimisation is enabled.  Such implementations should
# go into the lib/ directory so that they can be included by any test
# that needs them.  They shouldn't call any external functions in case
# those functions were overridden too.
