   --  This routine simply takes its argument and converts it to wide string
   --  format. In the context of the Wide_Image attribute, the argument is
   --  the corresponding 'Image attribute. Any wide character escape sequences
   --  in the string are converted to the corresponding wide character value.
   --  No syntax checks are made, it is assumed that any such sequences are
   --  validly formed (this must be assured by the caller), and results from
   --  the fact that Wide_Image is only used on strings that have been built
   --  by the compiler, such as images of enumeration literals. If the method
   --  for encoding is a shift-in, shift-out convention, then it is assumed
   --  that normal (non-wide character) mode holds at the start and end of
   --  the argument string. EM indicates the wide character encoding method.
   --  Note: in the WCEM_Brackets case, the brackets escape sequence is used
   --  only for codes greater than 16#FF#.
