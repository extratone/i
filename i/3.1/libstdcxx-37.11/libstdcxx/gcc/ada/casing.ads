package Casing is

   --  This package contains data and subprograms to support the feature that
   --  recognizes the letter case styles used in the source program being
   --  compiled, and uses this information for error message formatting, and
   --  for recognizing reserved words that are misused as identifiers.

   -- Case Control Declarations --
   -------------------------------

   --  Declaration of type for describing casing convention

   type Casing_Type is (

      All_Upper_Case,
      --  All letters are upper case

      All_Lower_Case,
      --  All letters are lower case

      Mixed_Case,
      --  The initial letter, and any letters after underlines are upper case.
      --  All other letters are lower case

      Unknown
      --  Used if an identifier does not distinguish between the above cases,
      --  (e.g. X, Y_3, M4, A_B, or if it is inconsistent ABC_def).
   );

   ------------------------------
   -- Case Control Subprograms --
   ------------------------------

   procedure Set_Casing (C : Casing_Type; D : Casing_Type := Mixed_Case);
   --  Takes the name stored in the first Name_Len positions of Name_Buffer
   --  and modifies it to be consistent with the casing given by C, or if
   --  C = Unknown, then with the casing given by D. The name is basically
   --  treated as an identifier, except that special separator characters
   --  other than underline are permitted and treated like underlines (this
   --  handles cases like minus and period in unit names, apostrophes in error
   --  messages, angle brackets in names like <any_type>, etc).

   procedure Set_All_Upper_Case;
   pragma Inline (Set_All_Upper_Case);
   --  This procedure is called with an identifier name stored in Name_Buffer.
   --  On return, the identifier is converted to all upper case. The call is
   --  equivalent to Set_Casing (All_Upper_Case).

   function Determine_Casing (Ident : Text_Buffer) return Casing_Type;
   --  Determines the casing of the identifier/keyword string Ident
