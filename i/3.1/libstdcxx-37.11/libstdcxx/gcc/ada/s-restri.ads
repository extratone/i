--  This package provides a run-time interface for checking the set of

--  comes both from explicit restriction pragmas present, and also from
--  compile time checking.

--  The package simply contains an instantiation of System.Rident, but
--  with names discarded, so that we do not have image tables for the
--  large restriction enumeration types at run time.
