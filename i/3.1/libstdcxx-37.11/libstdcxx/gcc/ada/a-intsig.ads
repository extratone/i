--  This package encapsulates the procedures for generating interrupts
--  by user programs and avoids importing low level children of System
--  (e.g. System.Interrupt_Management.Operations), or defining an interface
--  to complex system calls.

package Ada.Interrupts.Signal is

   procedure Generate_Interrupt (Interrupt : Interrupt_ID);
   --  Generate interrupt at the process level

end Ada.Interrupts.Signal;
