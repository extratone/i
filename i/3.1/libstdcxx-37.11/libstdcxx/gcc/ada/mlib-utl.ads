--  This package provides an easy way of calling various tools such as gcc,
--  ar, etc...

package MLib.Utl is

   procedure Delete_File (Filename : String);
   --  Delete the file Filename
   --  Why is this different from the standard OS_Lib routine???

   procedure Gcc
     (Output_File : String;
      Objects     : Argument_List;
      Options     : Argument_List;
      Options_2   : Argument_List;
      Driver_Name : Name_Id := No_Name);
   --  Driver_Name indicates the "driver" to invoke; by default, the "driver"
   --  is gcc. This procedure invokes the driver to create a shared library.
   --  Options are passed to gcc before the objects, Options_2 after.
   --  Output_File is the name of the library file to create. Objects are the
   --  names of the object files to put in the library.

   procedure Ar
     (Output_File : String;
      Objects     : Argument_List);
   --  Run ar to move all the binaries inside the archive. If ranlib is on the
   --  path, run it also. Output_File is the path name of the archive to
   --  create. Objects is the list of the path names of the object files to be
   --  put in the archive.

   function Lib_Directory return String;
   --  Return the directory containing libgnat

end MLib.Utl;
