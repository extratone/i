--  This package contains functions for runtime comparisons on arrays whose
--  elements are 16-bit discrete type values to be treated as unsigned.

package System.Compare_Array_Unsigned_16 is

   --  Note: although the functions in this package are in a sense Pure, the
   --  package cannot be declared as Pure, since the arguments are addresses,
   --  not the data, and the result is not pure wrt the address values.

   function Compare_Array_U16
     (Left      : System.Address;
      Right     : System.Address;
      Left_Len  : Natural;
      Right_Len : Natural) return Integer;
   --  Compare the array starting at address Left of length Left_Len
   --  with the array starting at address Right of length Right_Len.
   --  The comparison is in the normal Ada semantic sense of array
   --  comparison. The result is -1,0,+1 for Left<Right, Left=Right,
   --  Left>Right respectively. This function works with 4 byte words
   --  if the operands are aligned on 4-byte boundaries and long enough.
