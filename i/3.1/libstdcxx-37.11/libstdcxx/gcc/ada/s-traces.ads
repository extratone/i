--  This package implements functions for traces when tasking is not involved

--  Warning : NO dependencies to tasking should be created here

--  This package, and all its children are used to implement debug
--  informations

--  A new primitive, Send_Trace_Info (Id : Trace_T; 'data') is introduced.
--  Trace_T is an event identifier, 'data' are the informations to pass
--  with the event. Thid procedure is used from within the Runtime to send
--  debug informations.

--  This primitive is overloaded in System.Traces.Tasking and this package.

--  Send_Trace_Info calls Send_Trace, in System.Traces.Send, which is trarget
--  dependent, to send the debug informations to a debugger, stream ..

--  To add a new event, just add them to the Trace_T type, and write the
--  corresponding Send_Trace_Info procedure. It may be required for some
--  target to modify Send_Trace (eg. VxWorks).

--  To add a new target, just adapt System.Traces.Send to your own purpose.
