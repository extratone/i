--  This is a GNAT specific addition which provides a useful debugging
--  procedure that gives an (implementation dependent) string which
--  identifies an address.

--  This unit may be used directly from an application program by providing
--  an appropriate WITH, and the interface can be expected to remain stable.

function System.Address_Image (A : Address) return String;
pragma Pure (System.Address_Image);
--  Returns string (hexadecimal digits with upper case letters) representing
--  the address (string is 8/16 bytes for 32/64-bit machines).
