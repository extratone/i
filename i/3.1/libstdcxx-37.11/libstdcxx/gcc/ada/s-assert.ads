--  This package provides support for the GNAT assert pragma

--  This unit may be used directly from an application program by providing
--  an appropriate WITH, and the interface can be expected to remain stable.

package System.Assertions is

   --  Exception raised when assertion fails

   procedure Raise_Assert_Failure (Msg : String);
   pragma No_Return (Raise_Assert_Failure);
   --  Called to raise Assert_Failure with given message
