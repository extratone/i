--  This package implements a compiler phase that determines the set
--  of live entities. For now entities are considered live when they
--  have at least one execution time reference.

package Live is

   procedure Collect_Garbage_Entities;
   --  Eliminate unreachable entities using a mark-and-sweep from
   --  the set of root entities, ie. those having Is_Public set.

end Live;
