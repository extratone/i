--  The standard implementation of this spec contains only dummy interrupt
--  names. These dummy entries permit checking out code for correctness of
--  semantics, even if interrupts are not supported.

--  For specific implementations that fully support interrupts, this package
--  spec is replaced by an implementation dependent version that defines the
--  interrupts available on the system.

package Ada.Interrupts.Names is

   DUMMY_INTERRUPT_1 : constant Interrupt_ID := 1;
   DUMMY_INTERRUPT_2 : constant Interrupt_ID := 2;
