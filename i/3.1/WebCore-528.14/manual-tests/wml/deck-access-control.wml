<p> Test for Deck Access control in WML. </p>
<p> This deck will try to jump to "targetdeck.wml" when it is loaded. But it will <strong>FAIL</strong> because "targetdeck.wml" just allows "access-target.wml" to access it.</p>
<p> You can click 'Go' to enter 'access-target.wml', and then enter 'targetdeck.wml' from there</p>
