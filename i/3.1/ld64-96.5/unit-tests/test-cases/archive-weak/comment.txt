The point of this test if the linker already has a weak definition
it does not try to find another copy in an archive

There are two case to test:
1) both the main .o files and the archive have the same weak symbol (_foo)
2) main.o has a weak symbol and the archive has a non-weak symbol (_baz)
In both cases the linker should ignore the archive.
