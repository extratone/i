The point of this test is to verify a .o file can round-trip through ld -r correctly.  The ObjectDump utility is used
dump a "canonical" textual representation of a .o file.  The before and after .o files are then diff'ed.
No differences means this test passes

Currently for ppc64 the .o's alternate! in content
