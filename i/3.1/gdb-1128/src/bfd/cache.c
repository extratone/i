SECTION
	File caching

	The file caching mechanism is embedded within BFD and allows
	the application to open as many BFDs as it wants without
	regard to the underlying operating system's file descriptor
	limit (often as low as 20 open files).  The module in
	<<cache.c>> maintains a least recently used list of
	<<bfd_cache_max_open>> files, and exports the name
	<<bfd_cache_lookup>>, which runs around and makes sure that
	the required BFD is open. If not, then it chooses a file to
	close, closes it and opens the one wanted, returning its file
	handle.
