/* How you should pass arguments to a function depends on whether it
   was defined in K&R style or prototype style.  If you define a
   function using the K&R syntax that takes a `float' argument, then
   callers must pass that argument as a `double'.  If you define the
   function using the prototype syntax, then you must pass the
   argument as a `float', with no promotion.

   Unfortunately, on certain older platforms, the debug info doesn't
   indicate reliably how each function was defined.  A function type's
   TYPE_FLAG_PROTOTYPED flag may be clear, even if the function was
   defined in prototype style.  When calling a function whose
   TYPE_FLAG_PROTOTYPED flag is clear, GDB consults this flag to
   decide what to do.

   For modern targets, it is proper to assume that, if the prototype
   flag is clear, that can be trusted: `float' arguments should be
   promoted to `double'.  For some older targets, if the prototype
   flag is clear, that doesn't tell us anything.  The default is to
   trust the debug information; the user can override this behavior
