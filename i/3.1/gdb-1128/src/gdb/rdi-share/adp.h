 *
 * INTRODUCTION
 * ------------
 * The early RDP message definitions were held in an ARM Ltd "armdbg"
 * source file. Since the relevant header files were not exported
 * publicly as part of an ARM Ltd core tools release, it was a problem
 * for developers manipulating the target side of the protocol.
 *
 * For Angel, this new (ANSI 'C' clean) header file defines the ADP
 * protocol. The header should be useable by both host and target
 * systems, thus avoiding problems that can arise from duplicate
 * definitions. Care has been taken in the construction of this header
 * file to avoid any host/target differences.
 *
 * MESSAGE FORMAT
 * --------------
 * Format of the "data" section of debug and boot agent messages. This is
 * the standard ADP (Angel Debug Protocol) message format:
 *
 *  unsigned32 reason     - Main debug reason code.
 *  unsigned32 debugID    - Information describing host debug world;
 *                        - private to host and used in any target initiated
 *                          messages.
 *  unsigned32 OSinfo1    \ Target OS information to identify process/thread
 *  unsigned32 OSinfo2    / memory/world, etc. These two fields are target
 *                          defined.
 *  byte       args[n]    - Data for message "reason" code.
 *
 * NOTE: The message format is the same for single threaded debugging,
 * except that the "OSinfo" fields should be -1 (0xFFFFFFFF). Even
 * single-threaded debugging *MAY* have different host specified
 * debugID values, so the Angel debug system will preserve the "debugID"
 * information for replies, and the relevant asynchronous target-to-host
 * messages. The "debugID" is defined by the host-end of the
 * protocol, and is used by the host to ensure that messages are
 * routed to the correct handler program/veneer.
 *
 * The reason there are two target specified "OSinfo" words is because
 * thread identifiers may not be unique when processes/tasks have
 * private virtual address spaces. It allows more flexibility when
 * supporting multi-threaded or O/S aware debugging.
 *
 * NOTE: The reason that there is no "size" information, is that the
 * message IDs themselves encode the format of any arguments. Also it
  * would be a duplication of information used by the physical
 * transport layer (which is distinct from this logical message
 * layer). Any routing of messages through programs, hosts,
 * etc. should be performed at the physical layer, or the boundaries
 * between physical layers. i.e. packet received on socket in host,
 * and transferred to serial packet for passing on down the line.
 *
 * NOTE: Pointers aren't passed in messages because they are dangerous in
 * a multi-threaded environment.
 *
 * ADP REASON CODE
 * ---------------
 * The message reason codes contain some information that ties them to
 * the channel and direction that the message will be used with. This
 * will ensure that even if the message "#define name" is not
 * completely descriptive, the message reason code is.
 *
 *      b31    = direction. 0=Host-to-Target; 1=Target-to-Host;
 *      b30-28 = debug agent multi-threaded control (see below)
 *      b27-24 = reserved. should be zero.
 *      b23-16 = channelid. The fixed Angel channel number
 *               (see "channels.h").
 *      b15-0  = message reason code.
 *
 * It is unfortunate that to aid the error-checking capabilities of
 * the Angel communications we have changed the message numbers from
 * the original ARM Ltd RDP. However this also has benefits, in that
 * the Angel work is meant to be a clean break.
 *
 * However, it isn't so bad since even though the numbers are
 * different, the majority of the reason codes have exactly the same
 * functionality as the original RDP messages.
 *
 * NOTES
 * -----
 * It would be ideal to use "rpcgen" (or some equivalent) to
 * automatically maintain compatibility between the target and host
 * ends of the protocol. However, ARM Ltd expressed that the message
 * handling should be hand-coded, to avoid dependance on external
 * tools.
 *
 * All other channels have undefined data formats and are purely
 * application defined. The C library "_sys_" support will provide a
 * veneer to perform message block operations as required.
 *
 * It is IMPLIED that all of the ADP messages will fit within the
 * buffer DATASIZE. This has a minimum value, calculated from
 * BUFFERMINSIZE.
 *
 * All messages are passed and received to the channel system in little
 * endian order (ie. use little endian order when writing a word as
 * a sequence of bytes within a message).
 *
 * A reply / acknowledgement to an ADP message is always sent and has the
 * same reason code as the original except that the TtoH / HtoT bit is
 * reversed.  This makes it simple to check that the reply really
 * is a reply to the message which was just sent!  [Boot Channel messages
 * also require that this protocol is used].

/* The BOOT agent only supports a few messages. They are used purely
 * to control the "start-of-day" connection to a host program. All
 * Angel systems with host communications *MUST* provide the BOOT
 * agent, even if they don't have support for either the single- or
 * multi-threaded debug agents.
 *
 * The way the BOOT channel will be used on startup will be as follows:
 *
 * a) Target board is powered up before host debugger is invoked
 *
 * After switching on the target and initialisation is completed the
 * target will send an ADP_Booted or ADP_Reset message.  The debugger
 * has not been started yet so this message will not be received.  In
 * a serial world this makes it important that any buffers on the host
 * side are flushed during initialisation of the debugger, and in an
 * Ethernet world it makes it important that the target can cope with the
 * message not being received.
 *
 * Eventually the Debugger will be started up and will send an
 * ADP_Reboot or ADP_Reset request.  The target will respond to this with
 * an ADP_Reboot or ADP_Reset acknowldege and will then reboot, finally
 * sending an ADP_Rebooted when it has done all it needs to do (very little
 * in the case of ADP_Reset, but completely rebooting in the case of
 * ADP_Reboot).  Note that it is important that an ADP_Rebooted message is
 * sent so that the Debugger does not attempt to send any data after it has
 * made a request to ADP_Reboot and before it receives an ADP_Rebooted, as
 * data can be lost be the target during this time.
 *
 * The target and host are now ready to start a debug session.
 *
 * b) Target board is powered up after host debugger is invoked
 *
 * The debugger will send an ADP_Reboot or ADP_Reset request, but will
 * receive no reply until the target is powered up.
/ *
 * When the target is powered up then it will send an ADP_Rebooted
 * message to the debugger.  The debugger should accept this message
 * even though it has received no ADP_Reboot or ADP_Reset acknowldege message
 * from the target.
 *
 * The target and host are now ready to start a debug session.
 *
 *
 * If at any point during the bootup sequence and ADP messages are
 * sent down the S_DBG channel then they should be responded to with a
 * RDI_NotInitialised error. [This should never happen however].
 *
 * An ADP_Boot or ADP Rebooted message should be accepted at
 * any point, since it is possible for a catastrophe to occur (such as
 * disconnecteing the host and target during a debug message) which
 * requires that one or other end be reset.
