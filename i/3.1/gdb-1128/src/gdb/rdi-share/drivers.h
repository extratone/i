/*
 *  Function: DeviceRead
 *

 *              many data from the device as needed to complete the packet,
 *              but it should not wait if the packet is not complete, and no
 *              more data are currently available from the device.
 *            As an optimisation the read can optionally block when 'block'
 *              is TRUE, but only for a short time.  It is acceptable for the
 *              'block' parameter to be ignored in which case all reads
 *              should be non-blocking.
 *
 *  Pre-conditions: Device has been opened via DeviceOpen()
 *
 *    Params:
 *      In/Out: dc      Describes the packet being read (dc->dc_packet);
 *                      dc->dc_context is for the driver to store private
 *                      context, and is guaranteed to be NULL the first
 *                      time DeviceRead is called for a given packet.
 *
 *          In: block   If TRUE, read may safely block for a short period
 *                      of time (say up to 20ms), to avoid high CPU load
 *                      whilst waiting for a reply.
 *                      If FALSE, read MUST NOT block.

 *               0 (packet is not yet complete)
 *       Error: -1 bad packet
