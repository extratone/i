 * NOTE: Currently the Angel source is designed to be simple,
 * understandable and easy to port to new hardware platforms. However,
 * this does not always yield the highest performing system. The
 * current layered approach introduces an overhead to the performance
 * of the system. In a true commercial target, this code should be
 * re-designed to build a system where the Angel logical message
 * system, device driver and hardware accesses are merged to provide
 * the best performance.

/* Angel overview:

... some comments describing Angel ...

 * Angel is designed as a kit-of-parts that can be used to provide
 * run-time support for the development of ARM applications. The main
 * core of Angel is in providing support for the "debug" message
 * communication with a host system. These messages do not just cover
 * debugging ARM processes, but also the process of downloading ARM
 * programs or attaching to executing processes on the target.
 *
 * A stand-alone ROM based Angel world is the basic starting point for
 * a system, since it will allow programs to be downloaded to the
 * target. The ROM version of Angel will provide the generic debug
 * support, but no system specific routines. The preferred method of
 * using Angel is as a link library. This ensures that applications
 * carry with them the Angel routines necessary to support debugging
 * (and also ensure that the Angel version is up-to-date, independant
 * of the version in the target ROM). Eventually, once a program has
 * been fully debugged, a ROMmed version of the program can be
 * generated with the Angel code being provided in the application.

.. more comments ..

 * The standard Angel routines do *NOT* perform any dynamic memory
 * allocation. To simplify the source, and aid the porting to a non C
 * library world, memory is either pre-allocated (as build-time
 * globals) or actually given to the particular Angel routine by the
 * active run-time. This ensures that the interaction between Angel
 * and the target O/S is minimised.
 *
 * Notes: We sub-include more header files to keep the source
 * modular. Since Angel is a kit-of-parts alternative systems may need
 * to change the prototypes of particular functions, whilst
 * maintaining a fixed external interface. e.g. using the standard
 * DEBUG messages, but with a different communications world.
