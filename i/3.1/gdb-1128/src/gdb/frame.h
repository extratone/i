/* The following is the intended naming schema for frame functions.
   It isn't 100% consistent, but it is aproaching that.  Frame naming
   schema:

   Prefixes:

   get_frame_WHAT...(): Get WHAT from the THIS frame (functionaly
   equivalent to THIS->next->unwind->what)

   frame_unwind_WHAT...(): Unwind THIS frame's WHAT from the NEXT
   frame.

   put_frame_WHAT...(): Put a value into this frame (unsafe, need to
   invalidate the frame / regcache afterwards) (better name more
   strongly hinting at its unsafeness)

   safe_....(): Safer version of various functions, doesn't throw an
   error (leave this for later?).  Returns non-zero / non-NULL if the
   request succeeds, zero / NULL otherwize.

   Suffixes:

   void /frame/_WHAT(): Read WHAT's value into the buffer parameter.

   ULONGEST /frame/_WHAT_unsigned(): Return an unsigned value (the
   alternative is *frame_unsigned_WHAT).

   LONGEST /frame/_WHAT_signed(): Return WHAT signed value.

   What:

   /frame/_memory* (frame, coreaddr, len [, buf]): Extract/return
   *memory.

   /frame/_register* (frame, regnum [, buf]): extract/return register.

   CORE_ADDR /frame/_{pc,sp,...} (frame): Resume address, innner most
   stack *address, ...

   This is because, while B is inner-to A, B is not strictly inner-to A.

   must instead use frame_id_eq and frame_id_unwind.  For instance,

   get_frame_id: A low level frame unique identifier, that consists of
   both a stack and a function address, that can be used to uniquely
   identify a frame.  This value is determined by the frame's
   low-level unwinder, the stack part [typically] being the
   top-of-stack of the previous frame, and the function part being the
   function's start address.  Since the correct identification of a
   frameless function requires both the a stack and function address,
   the old get_frame_base method was not sufficient.

   get_frame_base_address: get_frame_locals_address:
   get_frame_args_address: A set of high-level debug-info dependant
   addresses that fall within the frame.  These addresses almost
   certainly will not match the stack address part of a frame ID (as
   returned by get_frame_base).

/* NOTE: cagney/2002-11-27:

   You might think that the below global can simply be replaced by a
   call to either get_selected_frame() or select_frame().

   Unfortunately, it isn't that easy.

   The relevant code needs to be audited to determine if it is
   possible (or practical) to instead pass the applicable frame in as a
   parameter.  For instance, DEPRECATED_DO_REGISTERS_INFO() relied on
   the deprecated_selected_frame global, while its replacement,
   PRINT_REGISTERS_INFO(), is parameterized with the selected frame.
   The only real exceptions occur at the edge (in the CLI code) where
   user commands need to pick up the selected frame before proceeding.

   This is important.  GDB is trying to stamp out the hack:

   saved_frame = deprecated_selected_frame;
   deprecated_selected_frame = ...;
   hack_using_global_selected_frame ();
   deprecated_selected_frame = saved_frame;

   Take care!  */

/* NOTE: drow/2003-09-06:

   This function is "a step sideways" for uses of deprecated_selected_frame.
   They should be fixed as above, but meanwhile, we needed a solution for
   cases where functions are called with a NULL frame meaning either "the
   program is not running" or "use the selected frame".  Lazy building of
   deprecated_selected_frame confuses the situation, because now
   deprecated_selected_frame can be NULL even when the inferior is running.

   This function calls get_selected_frame if the inferior should have a
   frame, or returns NULL otherwise.  */
