   Dynamic Linking on ARM GNU/Linux
   --------------------------------

   Note: PLT = procedure linkage table
   GOT = global offset table

   As much as possible, ELF dynamic linking defers the resolution of
   jump/call addresses until the last minute. The technique used is
   inspired by the i386 ELF design, and is based on the following
   constraints.

   1) The calling technique should not force a change in the assembly
   code produced for apps; it MAY cause changes in the way assembly
   code is produced for position independent code (i.e. shared
   libraries).

   2) The technique must be such that all executable areas must not be
   modified; and any modified areas must not be executed.

   To do this, there are three steps involved in a typical jump:

   1) in the code
   2) through the PLT
   3) using a pointer from the GOT

   When the executable or library is first loaded, each GOT entry is
   initialized to point to the code which implements dynamic name
   resolution and code finding.  This is normally a function in the
   program interpreter (on ARM GNU/Linux this is usually
   ld-linux.so.2, but it does not have to be).  On the first
   invocation, the function is located and the GOT entry is replaced
   with the real function address.  Subsequent calls go through steps
   1, 2 and 3 and end up calling the real code.

   1) In the code: 

   b    function_call
   bl   function_call

   This is typical ARM code using the 26 bit relative branch or branch
   and link instructions.  The target of the instruction
   (function_call is usually the address of the function to be called.
   In position independent code, the target of the instruction is
   actually an entry in the PLT when calling functions in a shared
   library.  Note that this call is identical to a normal function
   call, only the target differs.

   2) In the PLT:

   The PLT is a synthetic area, created by the linker. It exists in
   both executables and libraries. It is an array of stubs, one per
   imported function call. It looks like this:

   PLT[0]:
   str     lr, [sp, #-4]!       @push the return address (lr)
   ldr     lr, [pc, #16]   @load from 6 words ahead
   add     lr, pc, lr      @form an address for GOT[0]
   ldr     pc, [lr, #8]!   @jump to the contents of that addr

   The return address (lr) is pushed on the stack and used for
   calculations.  The load on the second line loads the lr with
   &GOT[3] - . - 20.  The addition on the third leaves:

   lr = (&GOT[3] - . - 20) + (. + 8)
   lr = (&GOT[3] - 12)
   lr = &GOT[0]

   On the fourth line, the pc and lr are both updated, so that:

   pc = GOT[2]
   lr = &GOT[0] + 8
   = &GOT[2]

   NOTE: PLT[0] borrows an offset .word from PLT[1]. This is a little
   "tight", but allows us to keep all the PLT entries the same size.

   PLT[n+1]:
   ldr     ip, [pc, #4]    @load offset from gotoff
   add     ip, pc, ip      @add the offset to the pc
   ldr     pc, [ip]        @jump to that address
   gotoff: .word   GOT[n+3] - .

   The load on the first line, gets an offset from the fourth word of
   the PLT entry.  The add on the second line makes ip = &GOT[n+3],
   which contains either a pointer to PLT[0] (the fixup trampoline) or
   a pointer to the actual code.

   3) In the GOT:

   The GOT contains helper pointers for both code (PLT) fixups and
   data fixups.  The first 3 entries of the GOT are special. The next
   M entries (where M is the number of entries in the PLT) belong to
   the PLT fixups. The next D (all remaining) entries belong to
   various data fixups. The actual size of the GOT is 3 + M + D.

   The GOT is also a synthetic area, created by the linker. It exists
   in both executables and libraries.  When the GOT is first
   initialized , all the GOT entries relating to PLT fixups are
   pointing to code back at PLT[0].

   The special entries in the GOT are:

   GOT[0] = linked list pointer used by the dynamic loader
   GOT[1] = pointer to the reloc table for this module
   GOT[2] = pointer to the fixup/resolver code

   The first invocation of function call comes through and uses the
   fixup/resolver code.  On the entry to the fixup/resolver code:

   ip = &GOT[n+3]
   lr = &GOT[2]
   stack[0] = return address (lr) of the function call
   [r0, r1, r2, r3] are still the arguments to the function call

   This is enough information for the fixup/resolver code to work
   with.  Before the fixup/resolver code returns, it actually calls
   the requested function and repairs &GOT[n+3].  */
