This directory contains header files necessary to build a thread-aware GDB on
systems based on OSF's CMA threads package.

The latest version of these header files are available for free from:

	http://www.osf.org/mall/dce/SW-code

Currently, the only port of GDB which supports CMA threads is HP/UX-10.10.
