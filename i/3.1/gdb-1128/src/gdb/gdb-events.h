/* This file was created with the aid of ``gdb-events.sh''.

   The bourn shell script ``gdb-events.sh'' creates the files
   ``new-gdb-events.c'' and ``new-gdb-events.h and then compares
   them against the existing ``gdb-events.[hc]''.  Any differences
   found being reported.

   If editing this file, please also run gdb-events.sh and merge any
   changes into that script. Conversely, when making sweeping changes
   to this file, modifying gdb-events.sh and using its output may
   prove easier. */
