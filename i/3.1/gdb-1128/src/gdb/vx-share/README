The files in this directory are shared with Wind River Systems' VxWorks
debug stub.  This stub runs in the realtime system, as a process, and
waits for net connections from GDB's and DBX's and such.

Do not change these files without coordinating with Wind River Systems
in Alameda, California.  Talk to postmaster@wrs.com to find out who 
currently maintains GDB for them.
