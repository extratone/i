	  * More bug fixes merged in from devo.

	  * gdbtk-cmds.c (gdb_cmd): Added an optional second argument to the
	  gdb_cmd, which is from_tty.  This is passed to the gdb command
	  parser.  It is 0 by default, and the console window passes 1.

	  * gdbtk-cmds.c: moved disassemble_from_exec from gdbtk.c to gdbtk-cmds.c
	  with all the other link-var'ed variables

  Tue Aug 25 18:13:30 1998  Jim Ingham    <jingham@cygnus.com>

	  * gdbtk.c (gdbtk_init): I hadn't excised ALL the old startup code, 
	  so it was not working correctly.  Now it does.

  Fri Aug 21 14:37:40 1998  Jim Ingham	<jingham@cygnus.com>

	  * gdbtk.c (gdbtk_init): Changed the startup code to use
	  tcl_findLibrary

	* gdbtk-hooks.c
	(tk_command_loop): change instream to a FILE.

	of providing own proto.

Fri Nov 13 00:15:08 1998  Geoffrey Noer  <noer@cygnus.com>

	Changes to account for name change from cygwin32 to cygwin and
	clean up Win32-related ifdefs.
	
        * gdbtk.c: lose "32" from cygwin_ func calls.  ifndef for
        checking DISPLAY should be for _WIN32, not WINNT.

	* gdbtk-cmds.c (gdb_set_bp_addr): Pass the type, enable & thread
	to gdbtk_tcl_breakpoint.

Wed Oct 28 10:14:33 1998  Jim Ingham   <jingham@cygnus.com>

	* gdbtk-cmds.c: Made the bdtypes & bpdisp arrays shared so they
	could be used in gdbtk-hooks.c (breakpoint_notify).
	Also fixed a few error messages to actually print the bp number
	rather that #%d...	
	* gdbtk-hooks.c (breakpoint_notify): pass more of the information
	about the breakpoint into the Tcl command, so it does not have to
	try and guess about information we have on the C side.

Mon Oct  5 00:34:00 1998  Martin M. Hunt  <hunt@cygnus.com>

	* gdbtk-cmds.c (gdb_set_bp_addr): New command. Sets a
	breakpoint at an address. Use this instead of gdb_cmd "break"
	because the syntax of the break command is broken and doesn't
	allow you to create a thread-specific BP at an address.  Also
	this is faster.

Sun Oct  4 22:35:47 1998  Martin M. Hunt  <hunt@cygnus.com>

	* gdbtk-cmds.c (gdb_set_bp): Add an optional thread number.
	(gdb_find_bp_at_line): New function. Returns a list of bpnums

	* gdbtk.c (gdbtk_cleanup): added a scope-level around the contents
	of the #ifdef so that the variable declarations in there would not
	be illegal in a C compilation.

Mon Jul 27 13:07:16 1998  Martin M. Hunt  <hunt@cygnus.com>

	* gdbtk.c (gdbtk_call_command): Removed because it is now
	in gdbtk-hooks.c

Wed Jul  1 13:10:58 1998  Jim Ingham   <jingham@cygnus.com>

	* Moved gdbtk_hooks.c & gdbtk_cmds.c to gdbtk-hooks.c &
	gdbtk-cmds.c to comply with the gdb conventions.  Changed the
	configure & makefile to reflect the change...
	
Wed Jul  1 11:07:21 1998  Jim Ingham   <jingham@cygnus.com>

	* gdbtk.c: removed all the commands and hooks from this file so
	now it contains only the startup code.
	* gdbtk.c (gdbtk_init): Fixed a bug in the startup code on Windows 
	that caused gdbtk not to find the share directory unless
	GDBTK_LIBRARY was set.
 	* gdbtk_cmds.c: New file - this contains all the Tcl commands that
	gdb defines.  All the old commands were moved here, the
	string-based commands were converted to object commands, and the

	shared by gdbtk.c, gdbtk_cmds.c & gdbtk_hooks.c
	* Makefile.in, configure.in & configure: mutatis mutandi for the
	new files.
	

Mon Jun 29 11:49:17 1998  Keith Seitz  <keiths@cygnus.com>

	* main.c (main): Don't include gdbtk test code if GDBTK is
	not defined by configure.

	* configure.in: When enabling gdbtk, add "-DGDBTK" to ENABLE_CFLAGS.

	* configure: Regenerate.
	
Fri Jun 26 13:56:07 1998  Keith Seitz  <keiths@cygnus.com>

	* gdbtk.c: Change all references to static global "interp" to
	"gdbtk_interp" and export this global.

Mon Jun 15 13:18:21 1998  Jim Ingham <jingham@cygnus.com>

	* gdbtk.c (gdbtk_init): Add elements to the auto_path AS LIST
	ELEMENTS.  This allows gdbtk to work when installed in a directory 
	which has a space in the path.  D. Moseley pointed out the bug.


Tue Jun  9 14:10:46 1998  Keith Seitz  <keiths@cygnus.com>

	* gdbtk.c (gdb_get_vars_command): Return static variables and

        (struct wrapped_call_objs): Change the `func' member to
        be a Tcl_ObjCmdProc, not an Tcl_CmdProc, since it accepts a vector
        of objects as arguments.  Change the object vector to be const,
        since that's what all the users of this structure seem to expect.
        (call_obj_wrapper): Cast clientData properly before storing it in
        the wrapped_args structure.
	
Thu May 28 17:19:14 1998  Keith Seitz  <keiths@cygnus.com>

	we can use this member to track real timeouts.
	(hardwire_readchar): Modify for cygwin32 so that we only ever use a real
	system timeout of one second. Track the "real" timeout as a series of these
	one second timeouts.
	Call ui_loop_hook to keep the gui alive.

	* top.c: Define new hook for cygwin32, "ui_loop_hook".

	* gdbtk.c (gdbtk_init): Add ui_loop_hook for CygWin32 to work around
	update problems.

Thu May 21 13:56:24 1998  Elena Zannoni  <ezannoni@kwikemart.cygnus.com>
       
	* gdbtk.c: reinserted the changes that were accidentally deleted:

	cygwin-specific call (cosmetic change). 
        (gdbtk_ignorable_warning): removed va_list parameter,
	which was unused.
        (_initialize_gdbtk): add cygwin32 specific code to
	allow `gdb -nw' to work when specified specified from a windows
	console-mode command line.

1998-05-19  Jim Blandy  <jimb@zwingli.cygnus.com>

	* gdbtk.c (struct wrapped_call_objs): Change the `func' member to
 	be a Tcl_ObjCmdProc, not an Tcl_CmdProc, since it accepts a vector
 	of objects as arguments.  Change the object vector to be const,
 	since that's what all the users of this structure seem to expect.

	the wrapped_args structure.

	* Makefile.in (install-only): Add images/icons.txt and
	images2/icons.txt to files that need to be installed.

Tue May 12 12:03:16 1998  James Ingham  <jingham@leda.cygnus.com>

	* gdbtk.c: Add an object call wrapper for the new Tcl_Obj based
	commands.  This way the obj commands will also go through
	catch_errors.  This is just a bandaid while I rewrite the
	string-based commands to use the object format.

Tue May  5 09:30:25 1998  Christopher Faylor <cgf@cygnus.com>

	* gdbtk.c (_initialize_gdbtk): Use correct device names in
