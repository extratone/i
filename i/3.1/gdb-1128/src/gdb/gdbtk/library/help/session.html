<center><h2>Sessions</h2></center>

Insight will save your session for you automatically.  The ``session''
is essentially a group of settings which are keyed by the name of the
inferior which you are debugging.<p>

Insight will show a list of the five most recent previous sessions on
the <tt>File</tt> menu.  Choosing an item from this list will cause
Insight to load the indicated executable and restore all the settings
saved in the session.<p>

The settings stored in a session are:
<ul>
<li> The name of the executable.

<li> The inferior's command-line arguments.

<li> The target.

<li> The path used when searching for source files.

<li> The current working directory.

<li> The breakpoints and watchpoints, including conditions, actions,
     and the like.
</ul>
<p>

More items may be added to this list as the need arises.<p>

At present there is no way to disable session saving.<p>
