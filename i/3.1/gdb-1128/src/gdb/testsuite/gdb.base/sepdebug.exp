# Modified to test gdb's handling of separate debug info files.

# This file has two parts. The first is testing that gdb behaves
# normally after reading in an executable and its corresponding
# separate debug file. The second moves the .debug file to a different
# location and tests the "set debug-file-directory" command.

# To do this we must run gdb on the unstripped executable, list 'main'
# (as to have a default source file), use get_debug_format (which does
# 'info source') and then see if the debug info is stabs. If so, we
# bail out.  We cannot do this any other way because get_debug_format
# finds out the debug format using gdb itself, and in case of stabs we
# get an error loading the program if it is already stripped.  An
# alternative would be to find out the debug info from the flags
