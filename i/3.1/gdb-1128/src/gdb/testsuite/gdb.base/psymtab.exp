# This test is looking for a bug that manifested itself when GDB was
# looking for a partial symbol such that there wasn't such a partial
# symbol in the psymtab, but such that the last psym in the psymtab
# had the right name but the wrong namespace.  Here, searching for
# zzz::dummy currently causes a search for 'zzz' in STRUCT_NAMESPACE
# without a preceding search for 'zzz' in VAR_NAMESPACE.

# APPLE LOCAL: Set "don't ask about future breakpoints" to on.  We really should 
# have asked whether to set a future breakpoint in this case, we only didn't 
# because of another bug in decode_compound.
