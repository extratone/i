# Testing the coalescing of C++ inline functions from header files.  These
# functions are emitted in each source file that include the header, 
# non-inlined when -O0 is used, and coalesced into a single copy by the
# static linker.  The static linker also tries to remove all of the debug
# information except one copy when it coalesces these.  If that debug 
# information defines a type that is later used by gdb, that results in
# <incomplete type> errors.

# This test file specifically tests for when the linker emits the debug
# information for the class AFTER the debug information for the executable.
# The debugger is supposed to handle this correctly, and only certain
# linkers reorder things in this way while they're emitting the coalesced
# debug info stuff.
