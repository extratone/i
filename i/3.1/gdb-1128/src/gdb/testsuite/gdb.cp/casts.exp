# Casting a pointer to a base class to a pointer to a derived class
# should yield the entire derived class.  Until August 2002, GDB got
# the enclosing type on `(B *) a' wrong: while the value's static type
# was `B *', as it should be, the enclosing type (which is supposed to
# be the dynamic type) was `A *'.  It's senseless to have a static
# type derived from the dynamic type; it should be the other way
# 'round.  Dereferencing this oddly typed pointer yielded a value in
# which only the base class's members were initialized, since GDB uses
# the enclosing type to decide how many bytes to read.  Members from
# the derived class were garbage, from GDB's address space.
