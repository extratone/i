# test basic Machine interface (MI) operations

# Verify that, using the MI, we can load a program and do
# other basic things that are used by all test files through  mi_gdb_exit,
# mi_gdb_start, mi_delete_breakpoints, mi_gdb_reinitialize_dir and
# mi_gdb_load, so we can safely use those.
#
# The goal is not to test gdb functionality, which is done by other tests,
# but the command syntax and correct output response to MI operations.
