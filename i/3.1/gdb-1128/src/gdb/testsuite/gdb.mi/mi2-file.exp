# Test essential Machine interface (MI) operations
#
# Verify that, using the MI, we can run a simple program and perform basic
# debugging activities like: insert breakpoints, run the program,
# step, next, continue until it ends and, last but not least, quit.
#
# The goal is not to test gdb functionality, which is done by other tests,
# but to verify the correct output response to MI operations.
