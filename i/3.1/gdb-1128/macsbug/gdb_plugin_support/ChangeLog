	before the function that used to contain it.
	* gdb_set.c: Ditto.

2004-03-24  Klee Dienes  <kdienes@apple.com>

	* gdb_special_events.c: Convert to the new breakpoint structures.

	instruction printing typedefs.
	* gdb_io_redirection.c: Remove references to
	TARGET_PRINT_INSN_INFO; remove instruction-printing stream code
	(the instruction printing code now explicitly takes a stream).
	This might still need some work, but it appears to behave
	correctly in basic tests.
