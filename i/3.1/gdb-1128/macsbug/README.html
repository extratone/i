<FONT SIZE=4><P><B>1. Introduction</B></P></FONT>
<P>
The MacsBug supported here is and extension to
<a href="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/DeveloperTools/gdb/gdb/gdb_toc.html">gdb</a> 
to support a subset of the Mac Classic
<a href="http://developer.apple.com/tools/debuggers/MacsBug/">MacsBug</a> commands and a
MacsBug-like screen UI.  Thus it basically is a variant of Classic MacsBug with source-level
debugging!
</P><P>
Along with this README there are three other files in this directory:
</P>
<UL>
<LI type=square><FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=+0>gdbinit-MacsBug-without-plugin</FONT></LI>
<LI type=square><FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=+0>gdbinit-MacsBug</FONT></LI>
<LI type=square><FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=+0>MacsBug_plugin</FONT></LI>
</UL>
<P>
Both <FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=+0>gdbinit-MacsBug-without-plugin</FONT> and 
<FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=+0>gdbinit-MacsBug</FONT> are gdb command language scripts one of which 
you <B>source</B> from your <nobr><FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=+0>~/.gdbinit</FONT></nobr> script (the 
script that gdb always looks for, and for what it's worth, it looks for a 
<FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=+0>.gdbinit</FONT> script in the current directory as well). In the 
following sections the difference in the two MacsBug scripts will be explained.
</P><P>
The <FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=+0>MacsBug_plugin</FONT> is just that; the gdb plugins that implement 
the MacsBug UI and commands. The plugin is loaded by the <FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=+0>gdbinit-MacsBug</FONT> script.
</P>

<p>&nbsp;</P>
<FONT SIZE=4><P><B>2. Background</B></P></FONT>
<P>
Once upon a time there was an implementation of Classic MacsBug for gdb using nothing but the command 
language provided by gdb. The file was called <nobr><FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=+0>gdbinit-MacsBug</FONT></nobr> 
(and since renamed <FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=+0>gdbinit-MacsBug-without-plugin</FONT>) and it is included 
with this release. It supports about 40 of the MacsBug commands.
</P><P>
It has the benefit of being totally portable, i.e., it should be able to be used with any version of gdb, 
on any Unix system, anywhere. It's down side is that it cannot do any more that what is provided by the 
rather limited gdb command language, is interpretive, and thus rather inefficient and in some cases slow, 
and cannot provide a MacsBug-like screen UI.
</P><P>
To get around these limitations the plugin support in Apple's gdb was utilized which allows the 
implementation be done in a "real" language. Thus the script <nobr><FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=+0>gdbinit-MacsBug</FONT></nobr> 
is provided which appears to be a very reduced form or <FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=+0>gdbinit-MacsBug-without-plugin</FONT> 
because most of the implementation is provided in the plugin (<nobr><FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=+0>MacsBug_plugin</FONT></nobr>) 
which <FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=+0>gdbinit-MacsBug</FONT> loads with a <B>load-plugin</B> Apple gdb command.
</P><P>
The benefit of using the plugin is that it is very efficient because it "talks" directly to gdb. It can 
provide functionality that the pure script variant cannot like some additional MacsBug commands and 
behavior as well as a MacsBug-like screen UI. It's down side is of course that it is tied directly to 
the version of gdb (and system) for which it was built. Further, because the script uses the 
<B>load-plugin</B> gdb command it will only work with Apple's version of gdb. Since MacsBug is mainly 
used by Mac developers this should be not be a serious limitation.
</P><P>
You thus have two choices:
</P>
<OL>
<LI>Install the totally portable <nobr><FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=+0>gdbinit-MacsBug-without-plugin</FONT></nobr> 
script, or,
</LI><LI>
Install the <nobr><FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=+0>gdbinit-MacsBug</FONT></nobr> script and the 
<nobr><FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=+0>MacsBug_plugin</FONT></nobr> file.
</LI>
</OL>


<P>&nbsp;</P>
<FONT SIZE=4><P><B>3. Installation</B></P></FONT>
<P>
The MacsBug files should already be installed in,
</P><P>
<nobr><FONT FACE="Courier"size=+0>&nbsp;
/usr/libexec/gdb/plugins/MacsBug
</FONT></nobr>
</P><P>
If you elect choice 1 then just add the following to your <nobr><FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=+0>~/.gdbinit</FONT></nobr> 
script:
</P><P>
<nobr><FONT FACE="Courier" size=+0>&nbsp;
source /usr/libexec/gdb/plugins/MacsBug/gdbinit-MacsBug-without-plugin
</FONT></nobr>
</P><P>
If you want to use the plugin then add the following <B>source</B> command instead:
</P><P>
<nobr><FONT FACE="Courier" size=+0>&nbsp;
source /usr/libexec/gdb/plugins/MacsBug/gdbinit-MacsBug
</FONT></nobr>
</P><P>
The <FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=+0>gdbinit-MacsBug</FONT> script is installed with it's <B>load-plugin</B> 
command defined as follows:
</P><P>
<nobr><FONT FACE="Courier" size=+0>&nbsp;
load-plugin /usr/libexec/gdb/plugins/MacsBug/MacsBug_plugin
</FONT></nobr>
</P><P>
The <b>load-plugin</b> command will load the <nobr><FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=+0>MacsBug_plugin</FONT></nobr> 
from it's installed directory when <FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=+0>gdbinit-MacsBug</FONT> is read (i.e., when 
the <B>source</B> command in your <nobr><FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=+0>~/.gdbinit</FONT></nobr> script is executed).
</P><P>
Of course you don't have to use the files in their installed location. They can be anywhere so long as the 
<nobr><FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=+0>~/.gdbinit</FONT></nobr>'s <B>source</B> command can access the 
<nobr><FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=+0>gdbinit-MacsBug</FONT></nobr> file with an appropriate pathname and the 
<nobr><FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=+0>gdbinit-MacsBug</FONT></nobr> script's <b>load-plugin</b> command can, 
in turn, access the <nobr><FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=+0>MacsBug_plugin</FONT></nobr> file.  The only 
restriction on the <b>load-plugin</b> command is that the specified pathname must be a full pathname 
(<FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=+0>'~'</FONT> cannot be used).
</P><P>
From this point on this README assumes you are installing the plugin.
</P>


<P>&nbsp;</P>
<FONT SIZE=4><P><B>4. Using Gdb's HELP Commands For MacsBug</B></P></FONT>
<P>
Once gdb is loaded type <B>help</B> to see a summary of all gdb command classes. There are three 
additional classes for MacsBug: "macsbug", "screen", and "useful".
</P><P>
Typing <b>help macsbug</b> gives a summary of all the MacsBug commands.
</P><P>
Typing <b>help screen</b> gives a summary of all MacsBug screen UI-related commands which are 
additions to this MacsBug implementation.
</P><P>
Typing <b>help useful</b> gives a list of "useful" gdb commands that could be used to extend the 
MacsBug script or for your own gdb <B>define</B> commands. Some of these are used internally, or 
are plugin descendants from the original gdb script, or are just plain useful in their own right 
and should probably be in gdb in the first place!.
</P><P>
Two existing gdb help classes, "aliases" and "support" also list some MacsBug commands. The "aliases" 
class lists aliases for some commands that don't follow the standard gdb command abbreviation 
conventions (e.g., <b>sc6</b> is the same as <b>sc</b>). The "support" class lists the <b>set</b> options.
</P><P>
As indicated at the end of the <B>help</B> class summary you can type <b>mb-notes</b> to get some 
additional information specifically related to this implementation of MacsBug. These notes are also 
repeated in the next section.
</P><P>
Finally, also as indicated in the <B>help</B> summary, typing <B>help</B> followed by a command name 
displays a summary for that specific command.
</P>


<P>&nbsp;</P>
<FONT SIZE=4><P><B>5. General Comments About Gdb MacsBug</B></P></FONT>
<P>
Below are a list of some general notes about the Gdb MacsBug. Much of this information is also 
available by type "mb-notes"(or help mb-notes) into gdb.</P>
<UL>
<LI type=disc>
The MacsBug support for gdb is as faithful a simulation as possible within the limits of the 
environment. There are also some extensions where it makes sense in the context of the debugging 
paradigm imposed by gdb. Also a MacsBug-like UI is supported (use the MB command to turn on the 
MacsBug screen).
</LI><P><LI type=disc>
The <i>$dot</i> gdb variable is the last address referenced by certain commands. This corresponds 
to Mac Classic's MacsBug <FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=+0>'<B>.</B>'</FONT> variable. For example, 
<b>sm</b> sets <i>$dot</i> to the first address that was changed. The default for many commands 
is to use <i>$dot</i> as their address argument. Typing <b>dm</b> will display the memory just set 
and set the last command to <b>dm</b>. A return after the parameterless <b>dm</b> command will use 
the <i>$dot</i> set by it to display then next block of memory in sequence. Note that this is the 
normal MacsBug behavior but that is different from gdb which would repeat the last command.
</LI></P><P><LI type=disc>
The <i>$colon</i> gdb variable is the address of the start of the proc containing the current PC 
when the target is running.
</LI></P><P><LI type=disc>
Only C/C++ can be debugged since the gdb commands use C/C++ syntax for their implementation 
(restriction imposed by this implementation's use of gdb).
</LI></P><P><LI type=disc>
Arguments are written using C/C++ syntax (e.g., use <FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=+0>-&gt;</FONT> 
instead of <FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=+0>^</FONT>, <FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=+0>!=</FONT> instead 
of <FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=+0>&lt;&gt;</FONT>, etc.).
</LI></P><P><LI type=disc>
Only one command per line allowed (gdb restriction).
</LI></P><P><LI type=disc>
Some restrictions on the commands that are supported. Do <b>help</b> on individual commands for details.
</LI></P><P><LI type=disc>
Decimal values are shown without leading <FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=+0>'#'</FONT> and hex is shown 
with a <FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=+0>'0x'</FONT> prefix (except in disassemblies and other displays 
where it's obvious it's hex).
</LI></P><P><LI type=disc>
The input radix is as defined by the gdb <b>set input-radix</b> command. The default is decimal 
unlike MacsBug which defaults to hex. Use the gdb command <b>show input-radix</b> to verify the 
input radix.
</LI></P><P><LI type=disc>
Many of the commands are not permitted until there is a target program running (using the MacsBug 
<b>g</b> or gdb <b>run</b> command). Most of the commands will cause some kind of error report 
until there is a target running. Of course with Mac Classic MacsBug there is always something 
running. But that's not the case with gdb.
</LI></P><P><LI type=disc>
Some of the MacsBug <b>set</b> options are supported. Use <b>help support</b> to see a summary of 
<b>set</b> commands. All the MacsBug <b>set</b> options start with <FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=+0>"mb-"</FONT> 
so you can use standard command completion (hitting tab after typing the <FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=+0>"mb"</FONT> 
will show you all those <b>set</b> options. For compatibility with Mac Classic MacsBug, <b>set ditto</b> and 
<b>set unmangle</b> are also supported.
</LI></P><P><LI type=disc>
Some Mac Classic MacsBug commands like <b>sc6</b>, <b>sc7</b>, and <b>sc</b> or <b>ilp</b> and 
<b>il</b> are identical in the gdb implementation. These alternatives take the form of gdb aliases. 
Use <b>help aliases</b> to see the supported aliases.
</LI></P><P><LI type=disc>
<b>Si</b> is defined as the MacsBug <b>s</b> command since gdb already has a <b>s</b> command. But 
this overrides gdb's <b>si</b> abbreviation for <b>stepi</b>.
</LI></P><P><LI type=disc>
When the MacsBug screen is being used command lines may be continued (using 
<FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=+0>'\'</FONT>) within the area defined for commands. The default number of 
lines is 2 but may be increased up to 15 using the <b>set mb-cmd-area</b> command. Continuing more 
than the allotted space is allowed but will cause the command lines to scroll up within their area. 
Unfortunately this does not happen if a command is interactively created with <b>define</b> and you 
try to continue one of the command's lines. The continuations are allowed. But they just don't scroll.
</LI></P><P><LI type=disc>
Unlike Mac Classic MacsBug, there is only one screen for gdb and the target program. Further, gdb has 
no control over output generated by the target program or caused by it (e.g., dyld messages). Thus the 
MacsBug screen could get "mangled". Use the <b>refresh</b> command to restore the MacsBug screen or 
turn off the MacsBug screen and debug with gdb's normal scroll mode. All the MacsBug commands still 
work in scroll mode and any commands that cause disassembly will display the current registers on the 
right side of the terminal screen (to minimize the affect on scroll back viewing).
</LI></P><P><LI type=disc>
A set of possibly useful commands for extending this script are available. Typing <b>help useful</b> 
will list those commands. You will see some output commands that write their output to stderr 
instead of stdout. This is only significant in the context of the MacsBug screen. When the MacsBug 
screen is on (<b>mb on</b>) all output goes into the history area. Output to stderr is written in 
<FONT color=red>red</FONT>. By convention this is be used for error reporting only.
</LI>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<FONT SIZE=4><P><B>6. Terminal Considerations</B></P></FONT>
<P>
Gdb MacsBug assumes it is writing to a terminal window that should be configured as follows:</P>
<UL>
<LI type=square>Xterm enabled</LI>
<LI type=square>VT100 or VT220 emulation</LI>
<LI type=square>8-bit connections</LI>
<LI type=square>Window size of at least 44 rows by 80 columns if the MacsBug screen is turned on</LI>
<LI type=square>Allows bolding of characters</LI>
<LI type=square>Supports colors red and blue</LI>
<LI type=square>Should use a mono-spaced font</LI>
<LI type=square>No translation</LI>
<LI type=square>Recommended font is Monaco 9 or at least a small enough font to fit within
     the MacsBug screen 44-line limitation</LI>
</UL>
<P>
With the exception of <b>bolding</b>, the OSX standard terminal window supports all these 
characteristics (use its preferences to configure for extra bolding). The only colors MacsBug 
uses are <FONT color=red>red</FONT> and <FONT color=blue>blue</FONT>. All other output uses the 
default font color.
</P><P>
Color and bolding are, of course, not a strict requirement. But Xterm, 8-bit support is. While an 
OSX standard terminal has no problems with these requirements you do need to verify them when using 
a Telenet program.
</P><P>
Finally, different terminal programs as well as the OSX terminal window itself have their own 
unique "quirks" and timing considerations or communication failures may mangle the display. If 
this should happen while the MacsBug screen is up you will need to type a <b>refresh</b> command 
to restore the proper display.
</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<FONT SIZE=4, color=red><P><B>7. Changes in MacsBug 1.6</B></P></FONT>
<UL>
<LI type=square>
Fixed the MacsBug <B>set</B> and <B>show</B> commands (broken by incompatibilities with gdb-477).

</LI></P><P><LI type=square>
Fixed the MacsBug screen display errors (same reason).

</LI></P><P><LI type=square>
Fixed a infinite loop handing nested '<'s in function names (e.g., C++ templates) during
disassemblies to the MacsBug screen.

</LI></P><P><LI type=square>
Fixed a bug where the MacsBug screen input (command) line was being erased when backspacing
over the first character (if the line was beyond a minimum length).

</LI></P><P><LI type=square>
Some 64-bit and other internal bug fixes.

</LI></P><P><LI type=square>
New <B>set</B> mb-objc-selectors [ON|OFF|NOW|SHOW] command to display the selector of a
Objective C message dispatch call in disassemblies if the call is at the current PC.  Default
is ON.
     
 </LI></P><P><LI type=square>
If <B>set</B> print demangle, <B>set</B> print asm-demangle, or <B>set</B> [mb-]unmangle
is ON then MacsBug attempts to demangle symbols if present in the comment field of disassmbled
lines if they are not already demangled.  For exmaple, C++ calls to symbols prefixed with
"dyld_stub_" are not shown demangled in gdb.
     
</LI></P><P><LI type=square>
<B>set</B> mb-wrap now controls the wrapping of disassembled lines when the MacsBug screen of
off in addition to its already existing control of the MacsBug screen history area lines.

</P>
</LI>
</UL>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<FONT SIZE=4><P><B>8. Changes in MacsBug 1.5</B></P></FONT>
<UL>
<LI type=square>
Fixed crashing bug when attempting to use the MacsBug screen (<B>mb</B> command)
that occurred with XCode 1.2.

</LI></P><P><LI type=square>
Fixed a bug where attempting to scroll through gdb's command history would
overwrite the side bar.

</LI></P><P><LI type=square>
Fixed bug where the macsbug screen prompt was being garbled when resuming
gdb after typing ^Z (control-Z) or changing the terminal window size while
the inferior is currently executing.
     
</LI></P><P><LI type=square>
Resuming from ^Z or a window size change while the inferior is running 
interrupts the inferior's execution exactly as if a ^C was typed.
     
</LI></P><P><LI type=square>
Fixed bug in <B>sb</B>, <B>sw</B>, <B>sl</B>, and <B>sm</B> commands when they modify
somthing showing in the macsbug screen pc area and the area was not being updated to reflect the
modification.

</LI></P><P><LI type=square>
Fixed bug where the branch taken information (shown in the MacsBug screen when the pc
is on a conditional branch) may be incorrect if it is the first break in the gdb session.

</LI></P><P><LI type=square>
Fixed bug to keep readline's ^R search "(reverse-i-search)" prompt from overwriting
the sidebar.

</LI></P><P><LI type=square>
Fixed bug defining <i>$colon</i> (current function start address) and made much more efficient.

</LI></P><P><LI type=square>
In the MacsBug screen side bar, if the program name for the "CurApName" field cannot
be determined then the PID is shown instead.

</LI></P><P><LI type=square>
Added support for 64-bit architecture.  MacsBug will determine whether the inferior is
32-bit or 64-bit and adjust its displays accordingly.

</LI></P><P><LI type=square>
New <B>set</B> <FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=+0>mb-arch [32|64]</FONT> command to
force the displays to the desired mode independent of the actual inferior mode.
Omitting the setting, i.e., <B>set</B> <FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=+0>mb-arch</FONT>
resets to the inferior's mode.

</LI></P><P><LI type=square>
New commands <B>dll</B>, <B>sll</B>, and <B>fll</B> to display, set, and fill (respectively)
long long (64-bit) values.

</LI></P><P><LI type=square>
New <B>dm</B> basic type keywords <FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=+0>LongLong</FONT>,
<FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=+0>SignedLongLong</FONT>, and
<FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=+0>Binary64</FONT>.

</LI></P><P><LI type=square>
<B>F</B> can be now be used as an abbreviation for <B>find</B> or <B>frame</B>.
Abbreviated as <B>f</B> <FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=+0>[arg]</FONT> implies a
<B>frame</B> command while <B>f</B> <i>addr n expr</i> is interpreted as a
<B>find</B> command.  The only exception to this abbreviation rule is with the
<B>help</B> command where you need to enter <B>help frame</B> to see that
command's help display.

</LI></P><P><LI type=square>
The <B>wh</B> command will, if the line information is unavailable, display
load segment information (which includes the segments type, address range,
and, depending on type, either the load address or pathname).
</P>
</LI>
</UL>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<FONT SIZE=4><P><B>9. Changes in MacsBug 1.4</B></P></FONT>
<UL>
<LI type=square>
Fixed bugs in <B>tf</B> and <B>tv</B>.

</LI></P><P><LI type=square>
Improved register display efficiency which greatly improves overall stepping speed.

</LI>
</UL>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<FONT SIZE=4><P><B>10. Changes in MacsBug 1.3</B></P></FONT>
<UL>
<LI type=square>
Fixed typeo in the <B>fb</B> help info in the reference to <B>future-break</B>.

</LI></P><P><LI type=square>
Fixed memory write commands (e.g., <B>sb</B>, <B>sw</B>, etc.) to detect when the memory is
inaccessible.
</P>
</LI>
</UL>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<FONT SIZE=4><P><B>11. Changes in MacsBug 1.2</B></P></FONT>
<UL>
<LI type=square>
Fixed all commands that potentially bcak up over gdb prompt to produce
a contiguous display to ensure the line is cleared before writing.
Previously, under certain conditions, a portion of the gdb prompt
would remain.  Commands affect are: list, next, step, nexti, stepi, db,
dw, dl, dm, dma, dp, id, il, ip.

</LI></P><P><LI type=square>
Added two new <b>set</b> commands:
</P><P>
<b>set</b> <FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=+0>mb-hexdump-width</FONT> <i>w</i><br>
<b>set</b> <FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=+0>mb-hexdump-group</FONT> <i>g</i>
</P><P>
These control the hexdump display width and byte grouping (e.g., the
output of the DM command).  The width is the number of bytes shown per
line.  The grouping is the number of bytes shown without intervening
spaces.  The default is a width of 16 bytes per line in 4 groups of 4
bytes each.  The width must be a multiple of the group.  Previously
the width was fixed at 16 in groups of 2.
</P>
</LI>
</UL>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<FONT SIZE=4><P><B>12. Changes in MacsBug 1.1</B></P></FONT>
<UL>
<LI type=square>Removed all references to the install-MacsBug script which was documented 
but never installed in 1.0.

</LI></P><P><LI type=square>
Changed plugin name from <FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=+0>MacsBug</FONT> to 
<FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=+0>MacsBug_plugin</FONT> which seems more appropriate. 
If you have your own copy of <FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=+0>gdbinit-MacsBug</FONT> you 
will have to change the <B>load-plugin</B> command (or continue naming the plugin 
with its original name).

</LI></P><P><LI type=square>
Removed the MSR and MQ registers from the sidebar.  Thus the minimum screen 
size is 44 lines.

</LI></P><P><LI type=square>
Added bullet to Terminal Considerations above noting that you need a small 
enough font (recommended Monaco 9) to fit within the 44-line MacsBug screen 
limitation (the default OSX Monaco 10 did not allow the screen on iBooks).

</LI></P><P><LI type=square>Fixed installation bug where the <B>load-plugin</B> pathname reflected the build 
directory as opposed to simply referencing 
<nobr><FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=+0>/usr/libexec/gdb/plugins/MacsBug</FONT></nobr>.

</LI></P><P><LI type=square>Fixed <B>log</B> command to handle <FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=+0>'~'</FONT>s in the pathname. 

</LI></P><P><LI type=square>Fixed plugin code to more gracefully coexist with Project Builder. There were
redirection interactions between Project Builder and the plugin.

</LI></P><P><LI type=square>Added tests in key points to prevent MacsBug from doing xterm operations when
not talking to a terminal as in the case with Project Builder.

</LI></P><P><LI type=square>Fixed a bug in the <B>td</B> command which had a format error displaying the XER SOC bits.

</LI></P><P><LI type=square>Added fixes so that the <B>mb-notes</B> help defined by <B>document</B> in
    <FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=+0>gdbinit-MacsBug</FONT>
displays correctly if <B>mb-notes</B> is used explicitly in Project Builder's gdb.
The <B>mb-notes</B> as defined in <FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=+0>gdbinit-MacsBug</FONT> has leading option-spaces to keep
gdb's <B>document</B> reading from skipping leading blanks and all blank lines.
These work fine on a terminal but do "funny things" to Project Builder's display of them.

</LI></P><P><LI type=square>Added recognition of all the abbreviations for the <B>list</B> command to allow these
to produce contiguous listings when the MacsBug screen is off.  Previously it only worked for <B>l</B> and <B>list</B>.

</LI></P><P><LI type=square>Made <B>next</B>, <B>step</B>, <B>nexti</B>, and <B>stepi</B> output be contiguous when
repeatedly specified with no arguments when the MacsBug screen is off.

</LI></P><P><LI type=square>Fixed bug in all contiguous listing commands (when MacsBug screen is off) 
when run from gdb <B>define</B> commands.  Backup over gdb prompt should not be done under such
conditions.

</LI></P><P><LI type=square>Enhanced the MacsBug <B>wh</B> command to display file/line information along with the source
line if possible.  Syntax of argument made same as gdb's <B>info line</B>.

</LI></P><P><LI type=square>Fixed bug in register display to adjust the stack display to account for a
changed window size.

</LI></P><P><LI type=square>Fixed scroll mode disassembly displays to wrap lines instead of being chopped
off by register sidebar.

</LI></P><P><LI type=square>Added <B>set mb-sidebar</B> mode setting command to enable/disable
the display of the register sidebar when the <B>id</B>, <B>il</B>, <B>ip</B>, <B>so</B>,
