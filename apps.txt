# Most Intriguing Apps
## An ongoing list of links to iOS apps, App Stories, and greater media coverage.
I’ve privately maintained a list like this for as long as I can remember, to be honest, but it’s never been particularly useful to others until now. Though it’ll probably never be alphabatized, standardized, or comprehensively annotated, it *will* be kept relatively up-to-date - certainly for the duration of my iPhone 12 Pro Max long review.
