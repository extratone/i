Textcraft is a magical utility that allows you to transform any text in real-time into a variety of 50+ different formats.

WHY YOU’LL LOVE TEXTCRAFT:

It’s built with iOS design guidelines in mind to look great in light and dark mode alike, along with containing multiple tints and themes to tweak the app your way. The intuitive ‘tap to copy’, and ‘long-press to share’ gestures coupled with the keyboard shortcuts also makes using the app super simple to pick up and use.

Multi-window support coupled with Drag and Drop is also extremely useful for quickly and easily dragging text from other apps directly into the app for quick transforming. Whether this is to add hashtags to words social picture sharing sites, or mimic mocking Spongebob in conversation with your friends, there’s something for everyone. There are also various ASCII text face emoticons for quick and easy copying.
