# Keyboard Shortcuts Bug Feedback Report
Note: this issue has occurred with Full Keyboard Access turned ~OFF~.
During the course of normal usage in Safari, Bear, Drafts, and Tweetbot, I have experienced four instances now (seemingly untriggered,) where keyboard shortcuts have ceased working. (Example shortcuts: ⌘ + Up and Down arrows, Unmodified Up and Down arrows to scroll, ⌘ + [ and ], ⌘+L. I can list more examples if it’d be useful.)
I have tried toggling the handset’s Bluetooth function on/off both in the Command Center and in Settings with no effect. Keyboard reconnects but the shortcuts are still unresponsive. The same goes for switching the keyboard itself on and off. The only solution appears to be rebooting the handset.
At this time, I don’t know what causes this issue. It’s happened seemingly at random.
