[1114YYYY-115411] italoboy#5539
This is the first scriptable themed icon.


[1114YYYY-121629] Lathryx#2826
Do you have to be jailbreaker to change icons to your own?


[1114YYYY-121659] Lathryx#2826
Why is slowmode on if this channel is also for discussion?


[1114YYYY-122409] italoboy#5539
No it is not jailbroken, I use Icon Themer shortcut for iOS 14 icon set.

Because it is lol. If you need to send more than one message every 10 seconds, you should reevaluate your messaging style üòÜ 

Icon Themer or Fancy Icon Maker work wonders for this

You can do it in shortcuts directly too but it isn't as clean when the shortcuts app has to open up

Shortcuts app doesn‚Äôt show up for third party apps.


[1114YYYY-222754] Lathryx#2826
That's great!


[1115YYYY-011229] italoboy#5539
I heard iOS 14.3 beta removed shortcuts totally and you can run any themed icon without needing that. 14.3 going to be a milestone update.

supermamon's no-background script is made specifically for this

I believe it supports all devices sizes


[1201YYYY-130104] dhshejsbeeksnsi#0969

What are you using for making widgets on desktop on macos?


[0103YYYY-125427] Stone#3378
So those three folders are called Panelicious, the weather is called Weather Widget, the Calendar is Mini Calendar and the quotes change every day (Or whenever you want) and it's called Desktop quote


[0103YYYY-125430] Stone#3378
@alombi


[0103YYYY-125512] Stone#3378
I drew the art with a similar layout in mind so That space to the right is the only active stuff on the desktop, everything else is just background


[0103YYYY-130109] alombi#4305

what is the music widget :(


[0227YYYY-021604] elmiembr0#0001
Widgets can‚Äôt actually control the music as you‚Äôd expect


[0227YYYY-021654] elmiembr0#0001
That was custom made with scriptable


[0227YYYY-021958] Doda#5023
Thx. Do u have any ideas good place to study sriptable to make theme like this?


[0227YYYY-022133] elmiembr0#0001
First is to know the basics of javascript and its syntax I‚Äôd say. A good place to start is sololearn, codecademy, and khan academy.


[0227YYYY-022205] elmiembr0#0001
It would make it much easier than going straight into scriptable without knowing anything


[0227YYYY-022235] elmiembr0#0001
Afterwards, you can get familiar with the modules in scriptable


[0227YYYY-022337] elmiembr0#0001
You can find a lot of answers to your code errors on stack overflow, but if you can‚Äôt find anything, you can always ask us.


[0227YYYY-022415] elmiembr0#0001
There aren‚Äôt many if any videos on scriptable on youtube


[0227YYYY-024245] Doda#5023
Thanks for your detail answer :))

the windows? the background?


[0321YYYY-183118] FifiTheBulldog#6153
I would assume for the widget itself


[0321YYYY-183427] DNMZ [Hashd]#5901
ok so the widget is Loner by HNDRK just search up his repo and you will have to tinker with the code for it to go light and dark. i honestly forgot what that code is but i think you have to use Filza and got to the widget directory and change the style.css and un comment the last piece of code and add the widget and dont turn on dark mode. if you do this incorrectly please tell me or send me a pic if the code

What is the widget on the left bottom. With multiple apps icon ? How did you do that please, ? And how about this Mac-themed window themed widget in the right side (bottom) , are those 3 colord dots in the corner even functional ?


[1116YYYY-005842] Omar Zoro11#6389
Sorry but one more question, how did you make that top left widget with the date /name, can you share the wallpaper pleases?


[1116YYYY-020056] Passi#9290
The dots are not functional. They are just the background image. I‚Äôll send u the images.

Hi Folks. My updated scriptable widget using Weather Cal and a photo I found on Twitter where someone added C&H.

thanks! i was going to make my own launcher widget but i didnt know one already existed, any suggestions on what i should start with? i havent made a widget before but i have decent experience with javascript


[0407YYYY-065740] mvan231#3698
You can recreate it in scriptable if you really want to but if you just want to launch apps from a widget, launcher will be a faster solution.


[0407YYYY-065813] mvan231#3698
Maybe we should move to #üôã-script-help or #üòÅ-general if you are interested in building something in scriptable


[0407YYYY-065817] ·≤º·≤º·≤º·≤º#6930
ok
