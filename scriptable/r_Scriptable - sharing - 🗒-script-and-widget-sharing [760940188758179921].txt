And the shortcut to go with it: https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/84193e6d2ca74d638ca33058c52b2881

It‚Äôs not quite done, I still need to clean up the code and write how to use it in the shortcut, but you run the shortcut, paste the Apple Music Link, and then save the files to the iCloud > Scriptable folder. Then you paste the text the shortcut has copied into the widget parameter

I threw one together that you can find here https://github.com/mvan231/Scriptable

This script will backup all of your current scripts into the iCloud Drive Scriptable directory underneath the folder "ScriptBackup" and then under "yyyy_MM_dd" folder that is created when it runs.

I‚Äôve been modifying the script to add customs urls for every country/us-states but I‚Äôm having some troubles cause not all the urls match with their names so I'd have to write them manually. But At least most of the urls are generated  correctly according to their flags  and also in different languages. The image show how the input is supposed to be writen    https://github.com/t4rtufo/widgets/blob/main/randomFlag.js

Thanks great stuff


[1221YYYY-060813] mvan231#3698
I forget who was asking for it and cannot find the post anymore (I think it was deleted) but I have finally reached a point with this widget that I feel it can be shared. 

You can get it here https://github.com/mvan231/Scriptable/tree/main/Upcoming%20Calendar%20Indicator as well as find more info about it. 

There are three ways to view the information.
1. Small widget as 'left'
2. Small widget as 'right'
3. Medium widget to see both

Calendars can also be excluded from the listings if you wish (see below)

 * **Credit goes to Raigo Jerva https://gist.github.com/rudotriton/b51d227c3d1d9cb497829ae45583224f#instructions for the original code that I modified to create the base of the view for the right side of the widget.**
        Inspiration was drawn from a comment on one of the r/Scriptable subreddit posts, but I cannot find it any longer. 
* This widget is similar to my Upcoming Calendar widget, but this now has a display for the full month view with indicators of up to five calendar colors for each day. 
    https://i.imgur.com/0QVdD7s.jpg
* Each calendar color only appears one time per date. 
* If you'd like certain calendars to not be included, you can add the calendar name(s) to the calIgnore array at the beginning of the script. 
    * **Note:** each calendar to be ignored must be added inside of single or double quotes and separated by a comma (if more than one). I.e. ['Personal','Work']
* If you'd like just the left or the right side of the widget to be shown in a medium or small widget, you can use the widget parameter of 'left' or 'right' respectively.

Changes: 
- add date URLs to the month view to allow you to tap on a date and go to it in the calendar app
- add spacing in cases where less than 5 events are found for the calendar event list (user choice to use this or not in the configuration section)
- add user choice for background color selection

[0114YYYY-003453] mvan231#3698
I've made some improvements and new implementations to my Upcoming Calendar Indicator widget based on some various feedback I have received both here in the sub and also on GitHub and Discord. 

New changes are:
- add in reminder support
- add in setup question for reminder support
- add option during setup for displaying the calendar color in the event list
- reminder emoji added to reminder title
- reminder list color added to display text color
- adjust current date indicator font size to better align with the other dates
- add in AM/PM indicator to the date shown in event list
- add ability to change the base text color between for each mode (light/dark)
- add setting for 24hr time vs 12hr for event list


An example of what v1.5 could look like with the new base color changes is like this image https://i.imgur.com/CORi5YL.jpg. This is utilizing base text color changed to red and the 24 hour time format. 

As before, you can see information and get the script from here on my GitHub https://github.com/mvan231/Scriptable/tree/main/Upcoming%20Calendar%20Indicator

Finally finished my first YNAB widget!

In case you don‚Äôt know YNAB is a budgeting app. Sadly, it does not have a widget but it does has an API you can use. As such, this shortcut will require you to first grab an API key from https://app.youneedabudget.com/settings/developer. Just put it into settings.token on the top of the file. 

To specify the behaviour of the script you need pass it some parameters (long/hard press on widget > Edit Widget > Parameter). The parameters syntax is quite simple: {mode},{comma separated list of category groups to include OR exclamation prefixed categories to ignore}. Notice how you choose which category GROUPS to include and which INDIVIDUAL categories to ignore.

The mode can be ‚Äòdouble‚Äô, ‚Äòwide‚Äô, or something else but it must be something. It controls the way the categories are displayed. There shouldn‚Äôt be any spaces in between each element. Capitalization matters. Categories to ignore can be prefixed with an exclamation point. 

Lets say you have a category group called ‚ÄúFixed‚Äù, which has quite a lot of categories within in so you want to use the double layout mode but you don‚Äôt want your ‚ÄúWater Bill‚Äù category to be displayed. You would use the following parameter: `double,Fixed,!Water Bill`

Script: https://pastebin.com/raw/4THEW7A9

In the screenshow you can see how each categorys name is displayed, followed by the group it is in. The number in red represent how much you spent in that category (rounded up) and number in green represents how much you have available (rounded down). The blue bar represents how much you have budgeted in that category and the green bar represents how much you spent in that category. The little red line is a pacer which is dependent on the goal type for that category, its deadline, and whether it even has a goal.

(Notice how the top left widget is a bit bugged. This is caused by trying to fit too many categories into a small widget. If that happens use "double" instead!)

I wrote a script **DirExplorer** to generate structured object data about directories and files.
Also you can see *Directory Tree* with it.

Hi! I wrote a twitter library for Scriptable.
Now this library supports:

- `.uploadImage()`
See more ‚Üí https://github.com/Kynako/Twista-js

It's been a long time since I have updated this one because most focus has been on Upcoming Calendar Indicator, but due to the request to add reminder support, I have now updated this widget to follow the similar technique. 

You can now choose to have reminders display in your events list and it will show whether it has been completed or not. 

Here https://i.imgur.com/jIB32gB.jpg 

To get the latest code for this widget, please see my GitHub page https://github.com/mvan231/Scriptable/blob/main/README.md#upcoming-calendar-events-widget

A (relatively) simple script for RoutineHub users like me who are so lazy that even filling in login credentials from a password manager is too much work. This automatically logs you in and presents RoutineHub in a WebView.

I've attached the .scriptable file for easy importing, but here's the code:
```js
const login = {
  username: "USERNAME_HERE",
  password: "PASSWORD_HERE"
}

const wv = new WebView()
await wv.loadURL("https://routinehub.co/login")
await wv.evaluateJavaScript(`  
  const details = ${JSON.stringify(login)}  
  for (const item of Object.keys(details)) {
    document.getElementById("id_" + item).value = details[item]  
  }  
  Array.from(document.getElementsByClassName("button")).filter(element => element.children.length === 0)[0].click()
`)
await wv.waitForLoad()
wv.present()```

I have been working on a few different updates and requests that users have had for my Upcoming Calendar Indicator widget.

Finally, the day has come where I can release v1.9.

The changes in 1.9 are quite significant in terms of beneath the surface code improvements. Overall the widget loads much faster and some new features were implemented as well for further customization.

the code for the widget is located here on my GitHub repo https://github.com/mvan231/Scriptable/tree/main/Upcoming%20Calendar%20Indicator

For an example of the latest version and what it could look like, you can see this screenshot, which shows usage of the saturdaySundayHighlight and the dayColor item to change the day initial colors.

I wrote a little function last night to combine images, just like you can do in Shortcuts with the Combine Images action (minus the grid layout option, I haven‚Äôt implemented that yet). It uses a DrawContext to draw all the images in the desired positions one after another.

```js
/**
 * Combine images horizontally or vertically.
 * @param {Image[]} imgs The images to combine.
 * @param {boolean} vertical Whether to combine the images vertically. When this is false, the images will be combined horizontally.
 * @param {number} spacing The spacing between images.
 * @returns {Image} The combined image.
 */
function combine(imgs, vertical, spacing = 0) {
  const dc = new DrawContext();
  let long_side = spacing * (imgs.length - 1);
  let short_side = 0;
  for (const img of imgs) {
    if (vertical) {
      long_side += img.size.height;
      if (img.size.width > short_side) short_side = img.size.width;
    } else {
      long_side += img.size.width;
      if (img.size.height > short_side) short_side = img.size.height;
    }
  }
  if (vertical) {
    dc.size = new Size(short_side, long_side)
  } else {
    dc.size = new Size(long_side, short_side);
  }
  let long_position = 0;
  for (const img of imgs) {
    let r;
    if (vertical) {
      r = new Rect(0, long_position, img.size.width, img.size.height);
    } else {
      r = new Rect(long_position, 0, img.size.width, img.size.height);
    }
    dc.drawImageInRect(img, r);
    long_position += (vertical) ? img.size.height : img.size.width;
    long_position += spacing;
  }
  return dc.getImage();
}
```

[0218YYYY-121039] FifiTheBulldog#6153
For as long as I‚Äôve been [an admin] here and learning about Scriptable, I actually just built my first truly practical script this morning. Figured I‚Äôd share it here.

It‚Äôs a very simple widget that gives me quick access to the menus of two different dining halls on campus, with the current URLs changing slightly as the date changes‚Äîessentially a pair of self-updating bookmarks that open in in-app Safari views. Without this, I would have to navigate a bit on the culinary services website to get to today‚Äôs menu. (I was previously using Shortcuts for this, but given the relative inefficiency and unreliability of Shortcuts, I decided to migrate my two dining hall menu shortcuts to a single Scriptable script. I think I made the right decision.)

Here‚Äôs my code, with the university‚Äôs domain and dining hall names replaced by generic placeholders. It‚Äôs meant to be added to the home screen as a medium-size widget.
```js
if (args.queryParameters.hall) {
  const { hall } = args.queryParameters
  
  const df = new DateFormatter()
  df.dateFormat = "yyyy-MM-dd"

  Safari.openInApp(`https://dininghalls.universityname.edu/menu/${encodeURIComponent(hall)}/all/${df.string(new Date())}`, false)
  return
}

const halls = [
  {
    name: "Foo",
    slug: "Barbaz Commons at Foo"
  },
  {
    name: "Lorem",
    slug: "Lorem Square"
  }
]

const wdgt = new ListWidget()

wdgt.addSpacer()

const title = wdgt.addText(Script.name())
title.font = Font.title2()
title.centerAlignText()

wdgt.addSpacer()

const stack = wdgt.addStack()
stack.layoutHorizontally()

stack.addSpacer()

for (let i = 0; i !== halls.length; ++i) {
  const hall = halls[i]
  
  const url = `${URLScheme.forRunningScript()}?hall=${encodeURIComponent(hall.slug)}`

  const wdgtButton = stack.addText(hall.name)
  wdgtButton.url = url
  
  if (i !== halls.length - 1) {
    stack.addSpacer()
  }
}

stack.addSpacer()

wdgt.addSpacer()

if (config.runsInApp) {
  wdgt.presentMedium()
}
Script.setWidget(wdgt)
```
