Faster refresh?
Is it possible to make the auto refresh faster on scriptable? I understand that it currently updates every 6-11 mins, but let’s say you wanted to display the time, or live sports scores, the 6-11 minute refresh wouldn’t really cut it. Is there a way to refresh every few seconds? Would this take up a ton of space/processing power on my phone?

[Release] Widget for Japanese app
https://github.com/MaximiliumM/JapaneseWidget

If you're studying Japanese, this widget is for you. I've been using the Japanese app by Renzo for a long time now – as a flashcard studying app and as a regular dictionary. It's super well-done and I thoroughly recommend it. Unfortunately, there's one missing feature at the time of this writing – Widgets. The app hasn't been updated for quite a while now and I really wanted to have some kind of widget for Japanese studying and I have no idea if it's coming at all. So I decided to make my own using Scriptable.

Creating the widget wasn't that hard. I exported my list of words and made the widget to display those words and their respective meanings randomly. But I wasn't satisfied. I wanted the widget to open the Japanese app and show the entry for that word. That was quite a journey, haha. The Japanese app has no documentation of its URL schemes, so I had to guess it! It took me some time but I finally did it. I sent an email to Renzo Inc asking about other URL schemes as well, but no reply so far :(

Be mindful that one downside is you have to periodically export your list to be used by the widget.

The end product is a mixture of Shortcuts and Scriptable – you use a Shortcut to install and to update your list of words.

Anyways, I hope this widget is useful to some of you out there :D

How do I position weather icon into the greeting widget?
Hey guys,

I’m pretty unfamiliar with javascript, so apologies if this is hacky. I merged the code form the popular ‘greeting’ widget and a weather one I found together as I wanted the temperature and current conditions displayed.

I managed to get the temperature displaying on the same line as the date as I wanted, however the conditions icon is currently floating to the right of everything to the side.

I’ve attached two images - one showing what I have currently and one showing what I ideally want.

If anyone could help me figure out how to do this that would be awesome!

You can find the Scriptable code here: [https://gist.github.com/nublarfan/cb1eb9ef65d2d680948a98b56a841cda](https://gist.github.com/nublarfan/cb1eb9ef65d2d680948a98b56a841cda)

Thanks!

Random MTG Card
https://i.imgur.com/I0oJcqZ.jpg

Made a very basic script to display a random MTG card from core set 21. It’s mostly a starting point, not sure if anyone here is interested. As someone considering getting into it I enjoy seeing and reading the descriptions of random cards. 

```JavaScript

// Show a random MTG Card

let card = await randomCard()
let widget = await createWidget(card)

// Check if the script is running in
// a widget. If not, show a preview of
// the widget to easier debug it.
if (!config.runsInWidget) {
  await widget.presentLarge()
}

// Tell the system to show the widget.
Script.setWidget(widget)
Script.complete()

async function createWidget(card) {
  let imgURL = card.imageUrl
  let w = new ListWidget()
  w.backgroundColor = Color.darkGray()
  if (imgURL != null) {
    let imgReq = new Request(imgURL)
    let img = await imgReq.loadImage()
    let widgetImage = w.addImage(img)
    widgetImage.centerAlignImage()
    w.url = “https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=“ + card.multiverseid
  }
  return w
}


async function randomCard() {
  let url = “https://api.magicthegathering.io/v1/cards?random=true&pageSize=1&contains=imageUrl&set=m21”
  let req = new Request(url)
  let json = await req.loadJSON()
  let card = json.cards[0]
  return card
}
```

Run inline script error
Hi i don’t know scriptable but i have to use it for my shortcut. When i run run inline script several times i’m getting this error:

Script completed without presenting UI, triggering a text to speak or outputting a value. If this is intentional, you can manually call Script.complete() to gracefully complete the script.

My code is:

let wv = new WebView()
await wv.loadURL('URL')
let html =await wv.getHTML()
Script.setShortcutOutput(html)
Script.complete()

How can i fix that?

Is draw context the best method for making a grid of images?
I’m trying to write a script that gets the users top albums from last.fm and presents them in a grid on a widget. I’m only getting a single image to appear and am unsure whether it’s because you can’t draw multiple images onto a canvas or if I’m using it incorrectly (I’m hoping the latter).

How to fetch html form url?
I’m try to make a widget with web crawling(use regular expression to to fetch some messages in the web)
It’s really easy to do on Python, but I can’t figure out how to do it with Scriptable app(JavaScript)

My biggest question is how to make HTML to the string?

let html= new WebView()
await html.loadURL("https://www.???.com")
let a= html.getHTML().toString();
let b= new console.log(a)

Awesome Scriptable indexing list for scripts on GitHub
Hey guys, I noticed a lot of people searching for an index of good Scriptable scripts and I would like to suggest for us all to index these nice scripts in an [Awesome List](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome), for those that already know GitHub, probably you already saw one of these, and for those that don't know, it's basically an indexing list for a determined subject, check on this link: [https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome).  


As the [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) is going on, we can enjoy this also for creating Pull Requests.  


The repository is in the following link: [https://github.com/cassianomon/awesome-scriptable/](https://github.com/cassianomon/awesome-scriptable/)  


If you want to add something in the index, just create a Pull Request.  


What do you think about this? If there is a better option and you have other ideas, let me know.

Getting "not a function" everywhere
I'm just getting up an running, and I wanted to write some widgets. Figured I'd start by grabbing some existing code and playing around. 

Started with this : https://talk.automators.fm/t/widget-examples/7994/2 figuring that it's pretty straight forward.

Got an error withere w.centerAlignContent is not a function. Ok, maybe deprecated or something? I comment out the line.

No I get an error where titleTxt.applyHeadlineTextStyling is not a function.

What the heck and I missing here?

Server Status Widget
Hi,

i'm looking for a widget based on Scriptable which displays the status of various servers. Ideally it would call a list of predefined URLs which will return a JSON with the status. If this is to complex, it could also only be called one server which will combine all the statuses in one response.

Has someone already created  something similar?   
and...is there a way to develop scriptable scripts on a desktop?

&#x200B;

thanks...Netsrac

Display latest HomeKit cam photo in widget.
Wouldn’t it be neat if you had a widget that displayed a recent snapshot of a HomeKit camera?

I wouldn’t even know where to start. I imagine getting a frame of video for the image would be tough. But if that was possible, the rest would be pretty simple in theory.

Is this worth exploring or is getting that image a non starter?

Just added a transparent date widget to my homescreen, but I’m now looking to add a bar that when you tap it it opens safari (it may be possible using a just a custom image file and in settings changing it to open url, then google or whatever default search engine the person uses.

Yes the google widget works, but I, and a lot of people like safari better, and plus just a search bar with a transparent background would be REALLY cool!

Lmk if you have any questions or made it! :)

Hi i don’t know scriptable but i have to use it for my shortcut. When i run run inline script several times i’m getting this error:

Script completed without presenting UI, triggering a text to speak or outputting a value. If this is intentional, you can manually call Script.complete() to gracefully complete the script.

My code is:

let wv = new WebView()
await wv.loadURL('URL')
let html =await wv.getHTML()
Script.setShortcutOutput(html)
Script.complete()

Can someone fix it for me?

Open specific calendar event with URL scheme
Hi!

I know about the url scheme "calshow://" to open up the calendar app, but I want to open a specific event (e.g. via the id).
I believe there a way of passing in parameters with the url. My assumption is based on the following experiment:

I tried a simple id call:
calshow://<id>
where <id> is replaced with the actual value.
The app opened and jumped to 01.01.2001, which I presume to be the default if the provided parameter is not found.

Any ideas or references on how to pass the parameters in?

As I'm interested in Scriptable, I made a shortcut which allows me to **grant hidden permissions** (such as Calendar or Location) of Scriptable!

and, I want to share this Shortcut with this subreddit users :3

You can select '**Launch**' in shortcut to begin Activation.

&#x200B;

[Here](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/fd9611d0beec4fe3948255d96ebee325)'s the shortcut link!

Can you tap the widget to open a different application?
I’ve got a personalised form of that super popular “Good morning” script that’s been making the rounds of /r/iossetups and am loving it. 

I feel like it negates any reason to have the calendar app on my Home Screen, as it *itself* tells me the date. 

Is there a way I can make it so that, instead of tapping into the Scriptable app, it will go to calendar?

Thanks.

Hey -

I’m using the weather script [here](https://gist.github.com/ImGamez/a8f9d77bf660d7703cc96fee87cdc4b0/e8d9308db6029f598c72ef71d6ece1b0febfdcda) and am a big fan.

I was able to incorporate some of the line changes in the comments section, so it pings the phone for location - which is cool. Changing units to Imperial was super easy. 

I’d love to make a few additional changes but need help, if possible (I’m not familiar enough with coding yet, but I do want to take the time to learn when I can):

1.	Swap the time out in the lower right to read the High and Low for the day (H: xx  L:xx)

2.	Ability to either have a pure black background or even store a wallpaper image in a scriptable folder on iCloud Drive to reference. Honestly, my background at the top is pure black so either should work great


If anyone has the time, I’d greatly appreciate it. 

Thanks.

Help with adding a string date instead of MediumDateStyle()?
hi

i'm looking to change the date format for future events shown on a widget.

it currently displays, for example, '17 Oct 2020 at 20:00' from the following script:

    let dateStack = infoRowStack.addStack()
    const dateFormatter = new DateFormatter()
    dateFormatter.useMediumDateStyle()
    dateFormatter.useShortTimeStyle()
    let parsedDate = new Date(Date.parse(e.strTimestamp))
    let formattedDate = dateFormatter.string(parsedDate)

    let date = dateStack.addText(formattedDate)
    date.font = Font.mediumSystemFont(10)
    date.textOpacity = 0.5

i'd like it to read 'Sat 17 Oct at 20:00' instead. what do i need to change?

from what I can gather the relevant string is 'E, d MMM', but I don't know how to set up the code to accept a string like that.

thank you

Issue with Widget
I've edited some code from some of the forums to create a reminders widget. It all works fine but every now and again I get the attached text in the widget which lasts for a few minutes (presumably it fails to refresh sometimes). I am a javascript newbie and am not sure what is wrong in the code. I was wondering if someone could assist with what is causing it? Code and screenshot attached.

    const BODY_FONT = Font.semiboldRoundedSystemFont(9);
    
    const today = new Date()
    const tomorrow = new Date(today)
      tomorrow.setDate(tomorrow.getDate() + 1)
      tomorrow.setHours(0,0,0,0)
    const tomorrow2 = new Date(today)
      tomorrow2.setDate(tomorrow2.getDate() + 2)
      tomorrow2.setHours(0,0,0,0)
      
    const BACKGROUND_DARK_MODE = "system" 
    // options: "yes", "no", "system"
    
    //

    const compareReminderDuedates = (reminderA, reminderB) =>
      reminderA.dueDate - reminderB.dueDate;
    const sortRemindersByDuedateAsc = reminders =>
      reminders.sort(compareReminderDuedates);
    
    /** Round date down to 00:00 */
    const stripTime = date => new Date(new Date(date).setHours(0, 0, 0, 0));
    
    /** d1 - d2: will be negative if d2 > d1 */
    const daysBetween = (d1, d2) => {
      const differenceMs = stripTime(d1).getTime() - stripTime(d2).getTime();
      return Math.floor(differenceMs / 86400000);

Wondering if it’s possible
1. Is there a way to get this to connect to Apple Music?

2. Is it possible to have an “invisible widget” when no songs are playing but a music widget when there is a song playing? Like without doing a iOS widget stack.

2.1. I currently have got a Spotify widget (I believe from creators Twitter) where it displays the album art (in a small portion of widget), name of song, artist and some other “quality of life” things like a Spotify icon and a shuffle and repeat button that are dimmed if not selected... However, when nothing is playing it will change to a background where it has ONLY a power icon and text saying “playback stopped”

That leads me to believe that it is technically possible but just wanted to know if other people have had the same idea or possible even tried this if it even possible.

Event countdown progress bar
Long story short I want a visual progress bar and “remaining days to event” countdown for my university final year project. There is different due dates along the year and I have them all as events on a calendar. I can’t figure out how to fetch the data from the calendars as I don’t understand how to use the ‘Calendar’ and ‘CalendarEvent’ variables. 

In my case I have the events in a separate calendar called FYP. How can I fetch these events from that calendar and get the remaining days to them?

Dithering photo effect
Hello there! I developed some widgets for my iOS 14 theme [https://system1-icons.com/](https://system1-icons.com/) inspired by the first Macintosh OS System 1. I wanted to make a widget that displays a random photo with a cool dithering effect, unfortunately Scriptable doesnt allow us to access to the pixels array (it exposes only the raw bytes). I've found a solution, but it's very hacky (and slow!), here it is:

I am trying to add an events listing to the space below the Weather line *(see screenshot below)* and I am having trouble. I have tried adding a widgetStack starting in line 230 of the attached link, but I can't get anything to work.

Any help would be much appreciated!

My idea for a widget
My idea foe a widget is at a specified time, you see a specific api.  For example if you take the train into the city, at 8:30 you want to see the next 3 trains for like a 10 - 30 minute period

Or let’s say you are a diehard sports fan, while you can’t get live updates, you can set it so on Sunday’s until like 5:00 it shows upcoming games, and then at 6:00 it shows the games results and winning plays

My final example, I’m not sure if it is possible, but it may be possible with an RSS feed, like however aviary gets top tweets, when you get out of school and work, it displays what major news events you missed, if anyone replied to your tweets / Reddit posts, and if anyone liked / updated

I’d like to see feedback on this idea, and possibly see it come to life at some point :)

Using the MIDI library in Python, it’s relatively straight forward. Problem is I want the code to be useable by others without much difficulty else I would have stuck with Pythonista.

Script Bounty
There are a lot of requests for scripts based on jailbreak type tweaks and widgets. 

I suggest a script bounty to help the developers of the scripts the same that happens when tweaks are requested (r/TweakBounty) 

What do you think?

Really need help: could somebody help me add an alternative time zone to script?
Hi all,

A bit homesick as I'm living away and am unable to return to my puppy because of travel restrictions.

On a practical note, I'd really like to see my home timezone just at a glance (British Summer Time) on my scriptable *script*. 

I'm using [this script](https://www.reddit.com/r/iOSsetups/comments/ivv66t/autumn_vibes/g5u3kj7/?context=3) from u/ben5292001, which is absolutely fantastic. 

Whereabouts in their [gist](https://gist.github.com/bjayers/28be68a96c2257da16a0f5f4f9283798) can I whack some new code in to make this a reality?

And, obviously (because I'm inept), what code actually is it?

Thanks for any help. If you have any puppy picture that's be greatly appreciated too.

Right now all widgets I see aren’t interactive / are glorified app icons.  My question is if it is possible for when you tap on a widget for it to not open in that specific app, but rather start a sequence (game); or something.

HomeKit Widget
Do any of you know if there is a script available or if you could create a script for a widget that shows a glimpse of the status of your home through HomeKit?

Similar to the one that is in the HomeKit app, where it goes through each device and shows which one is on, for instance showing the temperature the thermostat is set to, other data from sensors, etc.? I feel like this would be very useful, at least for me.

Automated custom battery percentage alert (like the low battery ones)
[Custom alert with lpm automation script](http://www.mediafire.com/file/lc2ovk9k5sverug/LPMalert.txt/file)

Many thanks to the original maker of this script and to u/FifiTheBulldog for helping me finding how to solve a mistake that I didn’t know how to correct.

Add this script to scriptables, make a simple siri shortcut which only triggers the low power mode and edit the strings.

After editing it, add this script (copy-paste) as an inline script in shortcuts automation for battery percentage and toggle run in app since shortcuts can’t display an alert other than with a notification. 

I don’t know how to code but the idea was simple to made and the code seems cleaned to me. (Also for what it does, I don’t think that it needs to be optimized)

(I’ll probably try to learn how to code in javascript, I’ve seen only widgets and specific scripts but nothing like the custom lpm alert, I wonder how far you can go with this on iOS)

Need help adding countdown element to mzeryck's Weather-Cal widget
Hey,
I came up with the code for a countdown widget but I can't for the life of me add it to mzeryck's Weather-Cal. When I do, I get an error in a completely different part of the script which I haven't touched. Can anyone help me with that?
Thanks in advance.

Can iOS Alarms be modified with Scriptable?
Using Shortcuts, I'd like to be able to modify the start time of several existing Alarms in the native iOS Clock app. Shortcuts by itself can only create new alarms or toggle on/off existing alarms.   
I don't want to create new alarms each time because I use different custom sounds for each alarm. I also don't want to have dozens of new alarms to constantly delete. I'm also aware of 3rd party apps for alarms, timers, etc.

Can something  in Scriptable solve this and allow me to modify existing native iOS alarms?

Widget Catalog
Hi everyone, I am currently working on a Widget Catalog, which will allow you to discover new widgets and load them directly into Scriptable. For the beginning I will only support my own Scriptable widgets in the catalog, but I can imagine to create a database of widgets later on, where everyone can submit his widgets.

The Catalog is based on the Shortcuts App (to make the installation easier) and Scriptable App.

What I have planned:

* The Catalog Script can update itself to a newer version
* If there is a newer version of a widget script, you can update to it
* That the switch to the Scriptable App is no longer necessary (the current version downloads the current catalog script and then executes this script in Scriptable using the X-Callback function)

What do you think about this idea? Maybe you have other cool ideas for the Widget Catalog. I am looking forward to your feedback.

This is what the current version looks like:

RoutineHub Downloads Widget
I always wanted a quick way to view my total download count of [RoutineHub](https://routinehub.co/) quickly but it was usually too much of a hassle. So I created a simple [Scriptable](https://scriptable.app) widget that allows me, or any other user, to view their RoutineHub's stats quickly **ON THEIR** **HOME SCREEN!**

Set Up

1. Add a widget to your home screen through Scriptable
2. Hold on it and Press 'Edit "Scriptable"'
3. Write your, or any other, RoutineHub's username in the parameter
4. That is!!

*You can also view your stats in the Scriptable app or with Siri.*

I’m using pdizin’s take on mzeryck’s weather cal widget to get reminders on my widget. My question is I can get reminders incomplete due today (reminder.IncompleteDueToday) or incomplete due this week (reminder.IncompleteDueThisWeek which is Sunday to Sunday), but is there a way to get reminders from 7 days ago to today? 

I imagine it could be done using 

Reminder.incompleteDueBetween() but I’m unable to find a way to get it populate correctly.

Any help is appreciated!

2 script requests
Does anyone know how to make a script for either of the following or have a script for either of the following?

First, a script that shows a truncated calendar. This would show the name of the event the start time and the day of the week. Preferably the day of the week would be at the top of the list of events for that day. Monday, October 5, then below that the start time and name of the event. Then Tuesday, October 6, then the lift at those events start time name of event. That’s it.

Second, a widget to show the latest tweets in a list from a particular Twitter name.

Hey guys, can someone help me? I try to solve a login on an website with username and password and than I want to grab some data to show in a widget!

Here’s the code I have at the moment but it didn’t work:

var user = 'Eric'
var pass = '123'

var v = new WebView(user, pass);
await v.loadURL('https://merch.amazon.com/dashboard');

let js = "document.getElementById('ap_email').value = user; document.getElementById('ap_password').value = pass; document.getElementById('ap-claim').value = user; document.getElementById('ap-credential-autofill-hint').value = user; document.getElementById('ap-credential-autofill-hint').dataset.claim = user; document.getElementById('signInSubmit').click();"

await v.evaluateJavascript(js);
await v.waitForLoad();  // that can take some time, e.g. until the last image has loaded too

js = ""

let result = await v.evaluateJavascript(js);
// do whatever with the data

// end of script, wait until the WebView is closed
await viewPromise;

What I have to do to solve this login? I hope someone can help me! Thx

URL logo shown on changing url content
Hi there.

I‘m pretty new to scriptable, so wanna try following:

get url http://192.168.178.40:81/web/subservices

search of keywords in html page and display image / photo based on keyword found 

As scriptable it should only display image / photo as url content can only be one


For example:
url http://192.168.178.40:81/web/subservices is having content keywords ProSieben

As result image located at https://de.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/ProSieben#/media/Datei%3AProSieben_logo.svg is displayed in scriptable 

If content keyword of http://192.168.178.40:81/web/subservice is changed icon is also changing to different image url


Support is most appreciated 

Thanks and regards

Hi there,

I'm only beginning to learn javascript but was wondering if anyone has made anything like this that I could build from. I haven't found anything quite like this online (reddit and automator forums).

Ultimately, I'm hoping to use the Shortcuts app to automate changing the contact photo of a given contact, and have that change the photo presented in a complication on my Apple Watch (that's currently the only way to show and automate photos as watch complications).

Hi Reddit,

how do you develop Scripts with scriptable? I think i haven't found the optimal workflow yet. Currently i'm using the following flow:

1. Create empty Script in App and name it.
2. Sync to mac with iDrive
3. Open empty Script on Mac on iDrive-Location
4. Edit/Code with favourite Editor
5. Test on Phone (script is automaticly synced to fon, when using iDrive)

Things without solution:

* Debugging (i like to do this easy on my Mac)
* Complex Workflow

Any suggestions?!

.replace(/\B(?=(\d{3})+(?!\d))/g, “.“)

But it didn’t work. Is there a way in scriptable to format strings?

fetch URL content and locate to URL based on fetched content
Hi there,

I'm pretty new to scriptable but wanted to ask on following what scriptable should do:

* locate to URL [`http://192.168.178.40:81/web/subservices`](http://192.168.178.40:81/web/subservices) 
* get content of tag `<e2servicereference>1:0:1:2F1C:441:1:C00000:0:0:0:</e2servicereference>`
* fetch `1:0:1:2F1C:441:1:C00000:0:0:0:` from content and replace `:` by `_` to get following as a result `1``_0_1_2F1C_441_1_C00000_0_0_0`
* locate to next URL [`http://192.168.178.40/picon/`](http://192.168.178.40/picon/) 
* get png from above' result `1``_0_1_2F1C_441_1_C00000_0_0_0` as new URL [`http://192.168.178.40/picon/1_0_1_2F1C_441_1_C00000_0_0_0.png`](http://192.168.178.40/picon/1_0_1_2F1C_441_1_C00000_0_0_0.png) and display "only" png in scriptable / widget

URL will remain the same, only content of tag `<e2servicereference>` is changing so scriptable has to work with variables.

Any thoughts how to go for this?

Maybe not perfect, but useful. Have fun!

This only supports public user accounts

This will get a random user from the ones you provide in line 1 and their 60 latest posts, select one at random and set it as the widget’s background image. 

Add user(s): On the very first line, it says let users = []
add your users between the brackets like this [“user1”,”user2”,”user3”]. You can add as many as you want. 

For multiple same size widgets: add a different parameter to each widget so that it is not the same image for all of them. 

IMPORTANT: DON’T RUN THE SCRIPT TOO MUCH.

Widget Overflow?
Anyone have any idea how to control content that is too big for the widget? I have a script that pulls my tasks from Todoist, and sometimes there are more tasks than can fit in the widget. When this happens, the top and bottom items are "chopped off". I would be OK with the bottom of the content being chopped off, but really dislike when it happens at the top.

For the date I added “datetext.leftAlignText(); but I don’t see the option to do that for weather or the top line :)

Awesome list of Scriptable widgets on GitHub
Hi there,
since there are some curated lists of scripts and widgets but most of them are on private servers, I created one on GitHub (most of the source code is there anyway). 

I decided to use the awesome-list style (but added pictures) as it seems the most common for such lists. 

To start with, the most starred and most liked widgets from GitHub and this subreddit are already added. 

Take a look: https://github.com/dersvenhesse/awesome-scriptable

Please don‘t hesitate to let me know about your feedback, additions and so on.

Thank you!

Hey guys,

does anyone knows a calendar widget like this?

So every appointment has only one line and in parameters i can set text size.

So if needed i can set to have >20 lines in the large widget.

Widget Hub
Hi everyone, I have publish the BETA Version of Widget Hub: [https://widget-hub.app/](https://widget-hub.app/)

&#x200B;

*Processing video radk5e199nw51...*

&#x200B;

  
Widget Hub will allow you to discover new widgets and  load them directly into Scriptable. For the beginning I will only  support my own Scriptable widgets in the catalog, but in the next step I will allow other Developer to add there widget-scripts.

The Catalog is based on the Shortcuts App (to make the installation easier) and Scriptable App.

What I have planned:

* Other developers can add their widget scripts
* Review process to protect the users for bad scripts, e.g. those who steal login credentails
* Sign scripts after the review process to prevent scripts from being changed afterwards

What  do you think about this? Maybe you have other cool ideas for the  Widget Hub. I am looking forward to your feedback.

Grafana Widget
Hi!

Next one. Hope it works for everyone as expected. You got to create an api key. Please check out the grafana documentation.

The small widget shows the state of all alerts combined. If just one is alerting, the widget is tagged as alerting, otherwise „OK“.
The medium widget shows counting by types.
The large one is showing the first 6 alerts as listed.

https://www.reddit.com/r/Scriptable/comments/jmnbqr/widget_showing_different_details_of_web_image_any/
Widget showing different details of web image - any ideas?
Dear community,

I'm not deeply into coding, but I would like to create a widget, that shows information about the groundwater level of Karlsfeld, Germany. The information is provided online at [http://www.gw-karlsfeld.de/gwm-krenmoosstrasse-1.html](http://www.gw-karlsfeld.de/gwm-krenmoosstrasse-1.html), but unfortunately **just as a image file**, that is updated once a week. The URL of the image is [http://www.gw-karlsfeld.de/images/Krenmoosstrasse.png](http://www.gw-karlsfeld.de/images/Krenmoosstrasse.png).

Therefore I have two questions:

1. Is it possible to show only defined parts of an image? In my case e.g. the part with the date, the groundwater level and the floor distance, e.g. as three image parts below?

https://preview.redd.it/4jz5oaubvtw51.jpg?width=939&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=75cbf86a2f97c8f3ff55fb6ea37ef744acf3a728

2.  Even better would be to get the information as text. Is there any possibility to get the groundwater level information from the image file by OCR e.g. by using a web service by handing it over with javascript and get the text back?

&#x200B;

For the moment I'm using the following widget code, that simply shows the right side of the diagramm. But I didn't find a possibility to show different parts of an image...:

`const widget = new ListWidget()`

`await createWidget()`

`if (!config.runsInWidget) {`

`await widget.presentSmall()`

`}`

`Script.setWidget(widget)`

`Script.complete()`

&#x200B;

`async function createWidget() {`

`widget.addSpacer(7)`

`widget.setPadding(40, 10, 0, 310)`

`const rawimage = await getImage()`

`let showimage= widget.addImage(rawimage)`

`showimage.imageSize= new Size(500,500)`

`showimage.rightAlignImage()`

`}`

`async function getImage(image) {`

`let imageUrl`

`imageUrl = "`[`http://www.gw-karlsfeld.de/images/Krenmoosstrasse.png`](http://www.gw-karlsfeld.de/images/Krenmoosstrasse.png)`"`

`let image1 = await loadImage(imageUrl)`

`return image1`

`}`

`async function loadImage(imgUrl) {`

Show an external HTML class in the widget
Hello,

How can I fetch a specific html class and just display the content of the class in the widget (and maybe resize it to make it fit into the small widget)?

More specific: I want the widget to check [this website](https://www.kronplatz.com/en/kronplatz/ski-lifts-slopes/ski-lifts) daily and display the % of the ski lifts that are currently open. The class would be `pull-left`

I guess it's pretty easy if you know Javascript, but my knowledge is very limited :D I know there is `document.getElementByClassName()` but I honestly don't know how to make this work. Any help is much appreciated!

The transit app lists out train times days in advance, so it should only have to gather the train times once every day or so!

I was wondering if refreshing meant gathering data from the internet, or if it is the widget communicating with the app :)

Trying to get better at this and am trying to customize a weather widget made by someone else but have a few questions
Here is the widget script (not mine): https://gist.github.com/ImGamez/a8f9d77bf660d7703cc96fee87cdc4b0

Here's a screenshot: https://imgur.com/rr8vLPI

It's a really neat minimal weather widget, and I've got my city name and lat/long in and it's working in that regard but I have a few questions about it because I'm really early in learning javascript, so any help is appreciated!

1. As you can see below the city name, it has a description of the weather. I'm having an issue where it seems to default onto "light intensity drizzle" as shown in the screenshot even though it's not drizzling. It's supposed to rain tomorrow, but even earlier today with clear skies, sometimes it would say clear skies, sometimes it would say light intensity drizzle. Is there a way to get better accuracy for this?

2. The raindrops are gray and really blend into the background are make them difficult to see. Is it possible to change the color of the rain drops to something more easily visible against the dark gray background like blue?

3. How difficult would it be to change it from an hourly weather widget to one that showed the daily weather for upcoming days?

Weekday incorrect in widget
Why isn't my weekday correct? Today is Nov 3:rd, but it is Tuesday! Not Wednesday (Onsdag in Swedish)

I use the script from this place: [https://gist.github.com/brainno722/18ab5266b12dbb351fe7942427500597](https://gist.github.com/brainno722/18ab5266b12dbb351fe7942427500597) 

&#x200B;

What is wrong?

Trying to whitelist dslreports.com speed test, unsuccessfully.
I'm trying to whitelist the [dslreports.com](https://dslreports.com) speedtest. I'm not able ([error](http://i.imgur.com/UALD7mJ.jpeg)) to make it working by adding:

[www.dslreports.com](https://www.dslreports.com) \- [dslreports-vm01.datapacket.net](https://dslreports-vm01.datapacket.net) \- [test2.dslreports.com](https://test2.dslreports.com)

Someone know which is/are the correct domain to whitelist for it? On the query log I can't find the correct request. 

Thanks!

I think a "Getting Started" guide needs to be made...
There's many people, including myself, that are obviously very new to Scriptable. I feel that creating a "Getting Started" guide might help with that. 

Maybe this could be added to the beginning of the documentation, like what Discord did. If we get people to help make this happen, I think it could be a great addition and even help expand this lovely community. 

It could start on GitHub, as a standalone thing (so that people can contribute), and later be integrated with the Scriptable app. 

Who would be up for helping me make this happen?

Published my first Widget Script: Vantilate Widget
Hey there! After I coded a lot of Scripts with Scriptable, I created a widget, which made it simple to me to keep an eye on the ventilation of my classroom in school. Maybe I need some more time to Code the widget than I can save me by it, but all other users can save time by using it, when you often need to ventilate a room in your office or school, ... 
There is a German version and description, but an english one too. One widget is to remind you on open a window and the other widget is to remain on closing the window.
Here are the scripts: https://github.com/Robby3St/Scriptables-WindowWidget
I hope I could help you with it :D

IDE with autocomplete?
This is an awkward question, I know but I hate writing code on my phone and since I'm extremely new to Scriptable, I sort of rely on the autocompletion that the app provides. Is there any Scriptable IDE for computers that has autocomplete for the Scriptable language? I know Javascript so it's just the Scriptable-specific stuff.

Thanks

Hi, I would like to add a contour or a shadow to the weather icons that are white since my background is white hence sometimes if the icons are entirely white they do not show at all. Please help. Thank you!!

In Google results if you click an address it opens google maps. I figured if you clicked the share icon in the results and shared it to a script, that script could open the URL, extract the address, and open it in apple maps. Doable?

Your Ultimate Daily Widget
The majority of it is not my code, it's a remix and tweaked version of the other widgets I've seen to make it more useful to me. 

—I've modified the gradient colors  (but I just like to stick with my background)

— Made Calendar Events & Reminders look clean

— Added location name to widget

You can get it from here: [https://github.com/AMITNKALRA/Widget-Scriptable](https://github.com/AMITNKALRA/Widget-Scriptable) 

Original Version was by: [https://github.com/mzeryck/Weather-Cal/blob/main/weather-cal.js](https://github.com/mzeryck/Weather-Cal/blob/main/weather-cal.js) 

Reminders help from: [https://talk.automators.fm/t/widget-examples/7994/311](https://talk.automators.fm/t/widget-examples/7994/311) and @supermamon on discord.

This in combination with Siri Suggestions = getting the most utilization out of your phone!!

UPDATE: I see he added reminders himself... oh well it was fun to do this anyways lol (But i think his version shows reminders that are also not due so you can chose whichever one you want to use)

AWS SDK in Scriptable?
Is there any way to use the AWS SDK im a Scriptable script? I’m used to scripting in Python and use boto3 there. I was wondering if I could access AWS APIs (example in aws-cli: „aws budgets describe-budgets“) in Scriptable as well. 

There’s always the way of implementing the AWS API call in an AWS Lambda function and expose an HTTP REST endpoint via API Gateway. This can then be accessed with „Request“. I‘d like to skip the extra step of deploying a Lambda for that though.

Apple Store Order Status Widget
Hi all,

I created a widget to see the status of the Apple Store order. Especially now the widget is interesting, after the numerous presentations of new Apple products. There are probably some orders on the way ;-) 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/5g918uyvnyy51.jpg?width=1125&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e137cd0f51ee331dce817fc2ebcb175eef53372f

The widget supports orders in all countries and default language for the remaining Days counter is english. But it supports also the languages de, fr, es and it.

You will find the widget script on https://widget-hub.app

I look forward to your feedback

If the widget does not work with your order, just contact me.

Image Size In Widget
So, I had a look in the documentation and found that I need to use img.imageSize (img is the name of the image) but I can’t figure out how to set a value to it. I have tried

‘’’
img.imageSize(10)
img.imageSize(“10”)
img.imageSize = 10
img.imageSize = “10”
‘’’

Any help would be greatly appreciated!

Hello,

Few days ago I'm pretty sure I've seen a widget that allows you to track different things and then  update the interface by adding ❌ or ✅.

I have tried to search the sub for "track", "tracker", "check", but nothing worked... 

Can anyone knows this script and can point me to it ?

&#x200B;

Thanks a lot :)

Copy image from clipboard without running in app?
Alright. So here’s what I’m trying to do.

I’m running the new iOS 14.3 public beta which allows for setting the wallpaper via a Siri shortcut or automation. I am trying to write a personal automation that changes the wallpaper at a certain time of day, but this is complicated by my use of the popular weather-cal script widget with a “transparent” background. 

I’ve got my shortcut also invoking a modified version of the weather-cal script that automatically sets the new transparency image by having the shortcut pass the relevant image to the clipboard before invoking the modified script which then reads the background image for the script from the clipboard. 

Ok, so the thing is it works, but only if I have the shortcut set to run the scriptable script “in app”, which launches scriptable obviously. If I keep that off and have it run in the background I get a type error in the line that writes the image to the temporary path that the script uses for nominal refreshes for the widget throughout the day. Something like “line xxx: expected type image but revived null”

Is what I’m trying to do possible or is it a limitation of iOS that scriptable has to run in the foreground to function properly in the way I’m using it? Ideally I’d like the whole shortcut to run with no user intervention. 

Thanks for reading!

Accessing photo albums
Hi, I came across this app and it looks amazing.  I don't have experience with iOS or JS but looking through the documentation I have not noticed an explicit API for accessing the photo albums.  Is this possible with FileManager instead? Maybe this information is not exposed?

I'm looking to write something to replace the terrible default Photos widget to display an album of your choice.

Weather cal “future weather” issue
I have the weather cal script working on my phone with everything how I like it. The problem seems to be with the future weather option. Everything shows up fine except the percent chance of rain displays NaN% instead of a numerical value. Any ideas?

Adapting Javascript Code - Random Image from Subreddit
I'm trying to work out how to adapt this code to work inside a Scriptable widget. I have some knowledge of Javascript but have only ever really done JS in tandem with HTML (like the code I linked to).

I've messed around a bit with the methods/functions below as well as some others in the documentation, but haven't managed to get it to work.

    new ListWidget(), addImage(), & Script.setWidget()

The code below is unmodified, as providing my subpar attempts at adapting it would probably make everything worse!

    // Place in your body:
    // <div id="image"></div>
    
    $(document).ready( function() {
      
    		var subreddit = 'VillagePorn'; // Your Subreddit without /r/
    		var aRandomNum = Math.floor((Math.random() * 25) + 1); // A random number - range 25
    		
    		$.getJSON('http://www.reddit.com/r/'+subreddit+'.json?jsonp=?&show=all&limit=25', function(data) {
    			$.each(data.data.children, function(i,item){
    				if (i == aRandomNum) {
    					$("<img/>").attr("src", item.data.url).appendTo("#image");
    					return false;
    				}
    			});
    		});	
    });

https://www.reddit.com/r/Scriptable/comments/k016zx/dynamic_html_title_to_ios_shortcut/
Dynamic HTML Title to iOS Shortcut
I'm trying to create an iOS Shortcut that accepts a URL and retrieves the contents of the `<title>` tag from that webpage. This would be simple, except I want it to work with Twitter permalinks – Twitter updates the page contents, including the title, using Javascript after the initial load. After a fair bit of trial and error, this is as close as I've been able to get: https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/4c350b52d3174c8db038f3458eb4cf6a

This works fine for most websites (including Reddit), but not for Twitter. Curiously, if I copy the in-line code from that Shortcut (below for reference), and paste it into a new script in Scritpable, it works fine for Twitter only in that case (fetching the title for the hard-coded test URL).

Any suggestions? Perhaps it's an issue with memory, or how I'm passing the data back? I'm new to Shortcuts and Scriptable, and have only limited Javascript experience, so I might be missing something small...

Thanks!

    const url = args.plainTexts && args.plainTexts[0] ? args.plainTexts[0] : "https://twitter.com/lehrblogger/status/391287397457330177";
    const interval = 300;
    const webView = new WebView();
    await webView.loadURL(url);
    
    async function getTitle() { 
      const title = await webView.evaluateJavaScript("document.title");
      // Twitter URLs pages start with no title, and then are progressively updated
      log(title);
      if (title != "Twitter" && title != "Tweet / Twitter") {
        Script.setShortcutOutput(title);
        Script.complete();
      } else {
        Timer.schedule(interval, false, getTitle);
      }
    };
    
    Timer.schedule(interval, false, getTitle);

FordPass Widget
**Hi everyone!**

I have created a script that fetches the information of your ford car and shows them in the scriptable widget. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/s4z46l6es7161.jpg?width=1242&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=59560bcde30bcd6cb6c0ba8bfac65a0a6c01b6bb

You can find the code here:

[https://github.com/dschablowsky/FordPassWidget](https://github.com/dschablowsky/FordPassWidget)

&#x200B;

You will need:

* iOS 14
* Scriptable App
* FordPass account
* Compatible car
* VIN of your car

For further information check the readme on GitHub!

Have fun!

What are some of your favorite widgets from Indies? Mine:

@scriptableapp - See my IG (i.e. pics of my kiddos)
@TheStreaksApp - No surprise if you've followed me for any amount of time.
@weatherlineapp - Widget alone converted me to a lifetime IAP instantly.

Want to test Scriptable for Mac?

The first builds of Scriptable for Mac are going to be *very* rough and unpolished. Expect plenty of bugs. But at least widgets seem to work.

Want to test Scriptable for Mac?

The first builds of Scriptable for Mac are going to be *very* rough and unpolished. Expect plenty of bugs. But at least widgets seem to work.

Haven't discouraged you yet? Get a build here 👇

Love these useful and aesthetically appealing widgets  on Mac OS thanks to @scriptableapp and @draftsapp. Amazing how ridiculously easy this kind of customization is now. And just another way my experience on Mac OS and now iPadOS feels continuous.

Same goes for big dev houses too, actually!

I more or less stopped writing to tech press two years ago, thinking that my apps are too niche. And they probably are.

But YOU should write to the press about your apps. It’s amazing when people put the time and energy into covering your app. https://t.co/0PXJgyxtAG

Getting backgroundImage to work in a widget
Hiya, sorry for a noob question. I’m having trouble getting backgroundImage to work in a widget.

Here’s the code:
https://pastebin.com/zLz17Vnt

I’m referencing an image that I have saved on iCloud, in Scriptable folder. You can also see commented part of the code where I tried with a direct URL link (same image, just on the web). For some reason all I’m getting with both approaches is a black background.

I can’t figure it out ;( Could you take a look?

How to make a clock
Hello scriptable community I’m new here.
Before this the only widget customization app I knew was that of kustom. It is really difficult for me to make anything in scriptable since I don’t know any coding or JavaScript. I did try to make a few by learning from examples. 

I wanted to a simple clock widget but I haven’t found the example of it yet. The one I’ve found uses html and I don’t know how to make a widget one. I’ve seen some widget from other apps that do sow time and minutes and update frequently (shows current time) so is it possible to make a clock widget in scriptable.

Thanks for reading so far.
Any reply would be a great help

My first @scriptableapp widget job offer: someone asked me to write a script to check how much money went into the cashpoints of his flower stores. Right from his homescreen. No need to log in to a PHP web app anymore. Perfect usecase for widgets. (Credentials as parameter)

Any Scripts to Blur the “Icon Section” of a wallpaper?
Are there any Scripts to blur the section of a wallpaper where icons can be placed? I’ll link an example here: https://i.imgur.com/xuYEm95.png

If there are none, would it be possible for someone to make one? I don’t know much JavaScript at all.

Preferably one with customizable blur strength and, if possible, a choice between a light/dark blur.

Siri is refusing to show parameters passed to an intent response when Siri is set to other languages than English. Anyone know why this might happen? It used to work. My intents definition file is localised to all the languages that Siri support.

I can't get Siri to show properties in intent responses when using other languages than English.

I remember I fixed the issue two years ago, but the fix no longer works.

I reproduced the issue in an example project: https://t.co/qqK37LKy7C

Ideas are appreciated 🙏

Reality: Start answering support messages at 14:00 and after writing mails, reproducing bugs, fixing bugs and filing feedback to Apple, I’m calling it a day six hours later.

A new API to show a “What’s New” screen when the app is launched after being updated. The screen shows release notes pulled from App Store.

I just went head first into the world of Scriptable, and i have a question.
Is it possible to make the wheater call widget larger? Or is the widget size itself Fixed, or is this widget to large for my Se2020?

Help to add transparency to widget
I have the widget below which basically shows reminders. I wanted to have an image as a background (using the wallpaper so I can have the widget appear transparent). I am not great with javascript and don't know how to amend the code to make it use the image as the background). Can someone help me with what to do?

    const tomorrow = new Date(today)
      tomorrow.setDate(tomorrow.getDate() + 1)
      tomorrow.setHours(0,0,0,0)
    const tomorrow2 = new Date(today)

I saw that Xiaomi Mi Home has API for some devices but I didn't understand how to use them and if there is the possibility to use them by a script.

Just wrote a piece on #DEVCommunity about how you can build custom iOS 14 widgets using #javascript and @ScriptableApp! 

I highly recommend checking out Scriptable – it allows you to build widgets that act as makeshift mobile "apps" for your web-apps!

One of my scripts vanishes
Hi scripters,
I made a script that shows me a countdown to rocket launches on a widget, but it disappeared from my scriptable app. All my other scripts are still there, except the rocket one. I created a new rocket script (I have a Backup of the code - not in scriptable itself, but very primitively in my notes app) but this new rocket script disappeared as well after a few hours. What on gods green earth is going on? Does it have to do with the memory threshold of widgets? Because I load some JSON off the internet and save it until the widget is built. 

Oh yeah and sometimes the script decides to appear again. For a few minutes it’s still accessible within the scriptable app, but a few later, it vanishes again. It’s just really annoying.

Events cut off - Weather-Cal
I recently updated my weather-cal script to the latest version (I was on the original weather-cal script). My events are not running across the whole widget. I have dug through the script but do not see where to modify this. Any help is appreciated.

Widget Showcase! Describe some of the experimental, unusual, or useful things you've made using Scriptable.
Greetings.

When I had my old Reddit account and was active in r/Workflow & r/Shortcuts, there was a weekly post were people did share or describe the workflows/shortcuts they worked on for the last week.

I thought semi-regular simple little thread to show off the stuff you made or are currently working on would be a nice idea for this sub too since Scriptable widget are a relatively new thing.

Feel free to share or describe your widgets - no matter if it's a modification, some experimental stuff or a finished widget.

Or just get some inspiration for your own scripts.

&#x200B;

Used "Tip/Guide", because it's required & there is no "discussion" flair. idk what fits best.

I'd like to use a widget on a white background,  
but I can't see the 'cloud icon' and 'etc white icon' with a white background. 

The way I thought about it,  
1) Adding shadows or black lines to the icon  
2) Changing the color of an icon  
But I don't know what to do...  
Anyone tell me how to solve it?

Automated change of background
Hi-

I was wondering if there’s way to script to change widget’s background (possibly transparent) when the device is set to regular/dark mode.

I.e, let’s say that I’m using weather cal with transparent background / the background is currently set to iPhone’s default mode change wallpaper, which is set to switch back and forth with sunrise and sunset. I would like my widget to change its background automatically in match with the wallpaper.

Is is possible at this moment? (I think I’ve seen a short clip where the background is automatically changed..

Thanks in advance :)

DWD Weatherwarings Scriptable Widget
Hy Anyone, 

i will ask anyone how can create me a Widget. My Idea is to Show local Weather Warnings from the DWD JSON API. I use a php script on my privat Webpage to show the Data. But my wish is to show this in a Widget in Scriptable. See the php script that I use now.  Hope anyone will do it. 

`<?php`       

`$jsonp = file_get_contents("`[`https://www.wettergefahren.de/DWD/warnungen/warnapp/warnings.json`](https://www.wettergefahren.de/DWD/warnungen/warnapp/warnings.json)`");`

`$json = extract_unit($jsonp, 'warnWetter.loadWarnings(', ');');`

`$alert_list = json_decode($json, true);`

`$relevant_alerts = $alert_list["warnings"]["106531000"];`

`$relevant_prealerts = $alert_list["vorabInformation"]["106531000"];`

`//$copyright = $alert_list["copyright"];`        



`if($relevant_alerts == null) $relevant_alerts = array();`

`if($relevant_prealerts == null) $relevant_prealerts = array();`

`$relevant_alerts = array_merge($relevant_prealerts, $relevant_alerts);`

`//Array sort:`

`$sortArray = array();`

`foreach($relevant_alerts as $key => $array) {`

`$sortArray[$key] = $array['level'];`

`}` 

 `array_multisort($sortArray, SORT_ASC, SORT_NUMERIC, $relevant_alerts);`

`//Titelzeile ausgeben wenn Warnungen vorliegen:`

`$numberOfAlerts = count($relevant_alerts);`

`if($numberOfAlerts == 1) {`

`echo "<div class='wrapper-item'>";`            

`echo "<div class='message-title message-img'>Es liegt 1 Warnmeldung vor!</div>";`

`echo "</div>";`

`} elseif($numberOfAlerts > 0) {`

`echo "<div class='wrapper-item'>";`            

`echo "<div class='message-title message-img'>Es liegen ".count($relevant_alerts)." Warnmeldungen vor!</div>";`

`echo "</div>";`

`} else {`

`echo "<div class='wrapper-item'>";`

`echo "<div class='message-titlecheck message-imgcheck'>Keine Warnungen</div>";`

`echo "<div class='message-text'>Es sind keine Warnungen für Gießen vorhanden.</div>";`        

`echo "<div class='message-subtext'>Quelle: Deutscher Wetterdienst</div>";`

Can anyone create a widget to show all events today and a few days in the future if possible? Kinda like the one for Fantastical here: https://i.imgur.com/V1divoV.png

I have very limited coding knowledge but I need it to show all events for the current day (including all-day events). The weather in the top right isn’t necessary for me, so that part can be skipped, and showing events a few days in the future would be a nice plus.

If you told me just a few months ago that people would be sharing Scriptable scripts and even *selling* scripts as they do now, I wouldn't have believed you. I'm like 🤯

Seeing that makes me so happy and proud to work on Scriptable ☺️ https://t.co/uKlALjhbpL

Just curious if it is possible to require in modules from NPM in a Scriptable JS script.
If this ability does not exist I think it would be really powerful to add at some point.

If anyone knows of a good work arounds that would be great. 

I am basically trying to use [moment](https://momentjs.com/) in a script.

Thanks

Looking for the best way to transfer scripts that I have written on my desktop onto my phone and run with Scriptable
My current thinking is to just stick the Scriptable script in a JS fiddle on my mac, open that fiddle on my phone and copy and paste into the Scriptable IOS app.

Is there a simpler way to transfer scripts you have developed?

Specifically, I'm hitting an HTML GET endpoint and am looking for a cookie value to use in the script.

Any help appreciated!

Adding to my iOS 15 wishlist:

A Shortcuts automation trigger that fires when I’ve fallen asleep. It should determine that by looking at data in the Health app.

I would use it to have Overcast pause automatically when I’ve fallen asleep.

Working with lines in TextKit seem almost impossible. Like if I wanted to make the text on line 117 bold, I would need to know that the first character on line 117 is the 1678th character in the document and TextKit can’t tell me that. It feels like I’m missing something obvious.

  ,selectCalendars: []

I want to omit one of the calendars on my phone, but I’ve tried so many different inputs and searched all over for instructions but can’t figure out how to make this work. 
How am I supposed to write in the selected calendars? 
Thanks for your help.

What about a marketplace to sell high quality Scripts?
Hi folks,

Big fan of Scriptable here.

On Friday  I saw someone trying to sell his script with Gumroad and it made me asking to myself: Would it be interesting to create a marketplace to centralize quality and paying scripts?

I put together a website without any expectations to receive feedbacks [https://scriptablum.com](https://scriptablum.com)

It is now time for this idea to go through the community and see how it is received.  
Do you think it is interesting? Should I drop it?

What Scriptable widgets do you actually use?
Scriptable was covered a lot on some german blogs and a lot looks fun widgets were presented (toilet paper counter for a popular german drug store), but mostly something I constantly need to see on my homescreen.

Do you actually use a lot of Scriptable widgets on your homescreen or do you rather use finished widgets that are provided from apps itself or other "widget making" apps like Widgy?

What Scriptable widgets do you use?

I really want to get to know the app better and see or read useful setups.

It could show you what you are currently watching and you could interact with the widget to continue a show you are watching.

Best practice for username and password
Recently created a widget showing friends online in Call of Duty. I’m using the widget parameter with username and password separated by a pipe so I can use regex to separate them out.

Unfortunately, this means that I cannot pull in the username and password in a Siri shortcut. Is there a best practice to storing username and password strings to have them accessible to both widget and Siri?

Maybe a potential fix down the line would be script specific secrets or the like.

Enjoy this small iOS & macOS widget I made to track my freelance income, using @Kontist SDK and @scriptableapp 
Good way to keep myself motivated! 💪 
Will share the code soon on Github...

Image from Sheets to be displayed as widget
I am trying to create the following:

I have a chart in Google Sheets containing the number of hours I’ve worked for the past five weeks. Within Sheets I’ve published the chart (as image), which I retrieves with Shortcuts and safe in iCloud with a weekly trigger. 

I want to use that image to display in a widget on my homescreen and I’ve tried the next two things:

1. safe the image to photos (and photo album) and use WidgetSmith to display the chart. 

This has the disadvantage that your photo library will contain many (old)charts as time goes by. 

2. Tried to get the file that is saved in iCloud to be displayed by combining Shortcuts and Scriptable. 

I’m quite new to writing JavaScript and could definitely use some help.

Can I write a script in python or is js required?
Hey guys, sorry if this is a dumb question.

Do I have to write the script in js or can I write it in python? Python is just a bit newer in my mind and I'd prefer not to go through the effort of refreshing at the moment. 

If not, does anyone know of a similar app where I could write a script in python for an ios widget? 

Thanks!!

I can add it as a custom item but it takes up too much space when it should fit just right

Can someone help me just remove that code that creates the calendar and put it into weather cal so it’s boundaries don’t take up the full size of a small widget.

Any TextKit experts know if there's a way for my subclass of NSLayoutManager to draw a background under the extraLineFragmentRect? 

The red part is drawn with drawBackground(forGlyphRange:at:) but it only extends to line fragments, not the last empty line.

Calendar widget
Hello, I'm looking for a medium calendar widget similar to this one (month view + upcoming events) with colored dots underneath the days that have events. Would be even better if it could include reminders too. 

This one is Calendar 366, it's very useful but unfortunately it doesn't have customization options (colors, background photo...).

Can anyone help me please? 

Thank you!

Your favorite app for making custom widget aside from Scriptable?
I think the widget making market is huge. 

You got:

* coding tool like Scriptable or Pyto 
* Shortcuts extension like WidgetPack or MFC Deck
* Editor with a graphic UI like Widgy or Widgetopia 
* Widgets that offer fixed layouts with customization options like Widget Wizard or Widgetsmith

&#x200B;

What apps you use in addition to Scriptable widgets and why?

What your opinion about those different types of apps?

Weather cal ubiquitous file error
I’m having an odd issue with the weather cal script. I recently just updated the code and it gave me this error

“
2020-12-16 15:02:45: Error: Failed determining if the file is ubiquitous.
“

I had no idea what this was so tried a couple more times and even created a new script with no changes and proceeded to get the same error. I restarted my phone as well and so far I’m still seeing this error. 

Any ideas?

Script to grab data from a numbers file
Hi, 

I have a number file that is my financial stuff like transactions and remaining balances. 

Is there a way to open the file and convert it to data I can use to create widgets so I don’t have to open the file to see the information?

Also a weird thing if I hard code the file path it doesn’t exists. It only finds the file path if i use a document picker. 

I have had the file for years but I have since found Copilot and saw their widgets. I want to see if I’m capable of creating similar with the data I use. 

Thanks for any help!

You can get it [here](https://github.com/mvan231/Scriptable/tree/main/Upcoming%20Calendar%20Indicator) as well as find more info about it. 

There are three ways to view the information.
1. Small widget as 'left'
2. Small widget as 'right'
3. Medium widget to see both

Calendars can also be excluded from the listings if you wish (see below)

 * **Credit goes to [Raigo Jerva](https://gist.github.com/rudotriton/b51d227c3d1d9cb497829ae45583224f#instructions) for the original code that I modified to create the base of the view for the right side of the widget.**
        Inspiration was drawn from a comment on one of the r/Scriptable subreddit posts, but I cannot find it any longer. 
    * This widget is similar to my Upcoming Calendar widget, but this now has a display for the full month view with indicators of up to five calendar colors for each day. 
    ![example image](https://i.imgur.com/0QVdD7s.jpg)
    * Each calendar color only appears one time per date. 
    * If you'd like certain calendars to not be included, you can add the calendar name(s) to the calIgnore array at the beginning of the script. 
        * **Note:** each calendar to be ignored must be added inside of single or double quotes and separated by a comma (if more than one). I.e. ['Personal','Work']
    * If you'd like just the left or the right side of the widget to be shown in a medium or small widget, you can use the widget parameter of 'left' or 'right' respectively.

Mini Widgy widget replication in Scriptable
&#x200B;

[Hi everyone, is it possible to replicate this widget in Scriptable? Widgy is still not capable to show the upcoming events, so the idea was to replicate it in Scriptable and add the function. Thank you all.](https://preview.redd.it/c401itcr5k661.jpg?width=319&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c5bb5d8c35230057d82f5c206f26f79fccdcc3b6)

Calendar, Circle Battery, upcoming events mini widget
I started a [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scriptable/comments/khjgpq/mini_widgy_widget_replication_in_scriptable/) to recreate a widget in Scriptable, so I tried to do it myself. It's not perfect, if you'll open the code you'll se, but it seems to work and it's exactly how it should have been and it's perfectly localized. I didn't start from nothing, I'm not able with this stuff, I used a base for the layout and some other examples, like the circle battery and the transparent wallpaper script, all the credits are present in the code. 

Here it is in case you're interested:

I’m pretty happy with the syntax highlighting and insertion of “character pairs” (eg. begin/end quote) now. Next thing to look at is better handling of indentation. https://t.co/yiziTe9XTf

Aqui esta un código donde muestras el porciento del año avanzado, la verdad es mas difícil la. interfaz y probarlo. no hay una documentación buena de como hacer el diseño.. pero bueno hay mas o menos quedo,

You can find your leaderboard status and information in this widget and it can rotate through multiple different servers as well.

Hi! I’ve been making use of a corona dashboard that had been posted here before. However whatever I try, I can’t seem to get the font smaller. Any number I try does not reflect on the widget.

**Introducing Pixel Widget**

Hello, everyone! I'm scriptable developer, **unvsDev**!

I was deeply inspired when I was using Google Pixel, which had an iconic "**at a Glance**" widget.

So I decided to implement the widget on my iPhone, and It went **really well**.

with Scriptable and my Pixel widget, you can now check..

*  your **upcoming event**
* customizable **greeting phrase**, based on current time
* **live weather** situation with cute icons
* **battery information** with percentage
* d-day count which is automatically checked
* with simple Google design
* and more!

So, Why don't you use this **\*epic\*** Pixel Widget?

Please enjoy the widget, and tell us what you think! 😎

A huge shoutout to **italoboy for Development** and **mvan231 for Beta testing!**

and **Max for Font Profile**, with our [Scriptable Lab community](https://discord.gg/BCP2S7BdaC) 🤩

&#x200B;

**Get Widget on Github**

[**https://github.com/unvsDev/pixel-widget**](https://github.com/unvsDev/pixel-widget)

or [Direct link to v2.0.2 Release](https://github.com/unvsDev/pixel-widget/releases/tag/2.0.2)

**It's free and open-sourced** : Why don't you give me a star? 🌟

Or you can [buy me a coffee](https://paypal.me/unvsdev) for Better future development! 😍🔥

&#x200B;

**How to Install Pixel Widget?**

First, you need to install both **Pixel Widget and Pixel Launcher**.

Widget thing has the main code, and Launcher lets you customize the widget.

Then, Tap Widget...

I have a vision. back double tap > activates screen "swipe left" action.
if it already exists and someone can give me directions on how to implement it I will give him 1 million dollars....

so basically I want to set the double-tap on the back of my iPhone to trigger a shortcut that "swipes left"  from the page I am in.

you know how you enter a page and the only way to go back is either by swiping left on the screen or by pressing the top left corner on the "go back" button. I hate these hands gymnastics and would like to set the back double tap to enable the "go back swipe" on my screen, IS IT POSSIBLE?!

I have tried it in different spots in the script, I have removed the background colour module and readded it, I have tried turning the colour into rgba so it has 0 opacity, all the no avail.

Any input would be appreciated!

Alert not working in shortcut
Hi

I have created a scriptable script that checks if customer folder exist. I have done this in scriptable but iOS shortcuts doesn’t allow alerts, so how do I have an alert pop up to say the customer exists?

Here is my script.

<code>

let fmCloud = FileManager.iCloud() // {}
let strPath = fmCloud.bookmarkedPath("Clients") //Must setup a file bookmark up in Scriptable called Clients first to the followingf url /private/var/mobile/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Work/Client
let InputName ="the ABC company"; //the ABC company

//Create Basename - START

function CreateBasename(InputName) {
    // Change Case - START
    const toCapitaliseCase = (phrase) => {
        return phrase
        .split(' ')
        .map(word => word.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + word.slice(1))
        .join(' ');
    };
    let Capitalise = toCapitaliseCase(InputName);
    // Change Case - END
    // return capitalise; // The ABC Company
    
    // Format Client Name if starts with 'The' - START
    if (Capitalise.startsWith('The ')) { //The ABC Company
        let Words = Capitalise.split(' '); //["The","ABC","Company"]
        let The = Words[0]; // The
        let TheSlice = Capitalise.slice(4); //ABC Company
        let Comma = ', '; // ,
        let BaseName = TheSlice.concat('', Comma, The); // ABC Company, The
        return BaseName //ABC Company, The
    }
    // Format Client Name if it DOESN'T start with 'The' - START
    else { //The ABC Company
        return Capitalise
    }
    
}
var BaseName = CreateBasename(InputName);
//console.log (BaseName) //ABC Company, The

//Create Basename - END


//Check if a folder with BaseName exists - START

function DoesFolderExist(InputName) {
  let ListContents = fmCloud.listContents(strPath).filter(x => x.includes(BaseName));
    var x = ListContents.toString();
    let hello = fmCloud.isDirectory(strPath);

Apply tint color to images/SfSymbols NOT presented as a WidgetImage?
Greetings,

I want to use SFSymbols in a DrawContext enviroment.

I know that there is a tintColor option if you use it as a WidgetImage, but I haven't seen a way to change the tintColor of a SFSymbol used somewhere else.

Working with stacks and spacers is kind of limitedd if you want to align elements more freely.

For example I want to change the pencil to red: 

`let dc = new DrawContext()`

`dc.opaque=false`

`dc.size = new Size(200,200)`

`dc.drawImageInRect(SFSymbol.named("scribble").image, new Rect(50,50,70,70))`

`dc.drawImageInRect(SFSymbol.named("pencil").image, new Rect(105,40,70,70))`

`image = dc.getImage()`

`QuickLook.present(image)`

Is this possible?

Weather Cal Error
Today out of the blue my weather cal widget started showing a white background. As I looked into it I discovered this error. 

2020-12-27 17:48:29: The 215 item in your layout is unavailable. Check for misspellings or other formatting issues. If you have any custom items, ensure they are set up correctly.

Any ideas?

Script: https://github.com/mzeryck/Weather-Cal

I’ve removed a lot of the contents of the weather cal script to use it as a calendar events/reminder/to-do list widget that is right on my Home Screen. 

Is there anyway to get the text of the widget near the top of the widget? Without having to have the numberOfevents/numberOfreminders set too high numbers and have it filled up like this: https://i.imgur.com/7stpyMK.jpg

Thanks

Need help with Alert() function
I am attempting to create a natural language processor for adding events to Calendar. So far, however, I’m getting stuck on creating the alert to enter text into. Here is my current code:

```
function createEventDialog() {
    var alert = new Alert();
    var placeholder = "Meeting at XYZ Street at 0900 on 11/11/2011";
    
    alert.title = "Enter event description";
    alert.addTextField(placeholder);
    alert.addAction("Create Event");
    alert.addCancelAction("Nevermind");
    
    await alert.presentAlert();
    
    return alert.textFieldValue(0);
}
```

When I run this and simply try to `console.log()` the returned value, I get a syntax error for `Unexpected Identifier ‘alert’`. If I remove the `await` then it runs but obviously returns `null` for the text field. I’m completely stumped here. Anyone smarter than me have suggestions or ideas?

Google “at a glance”
I have a scriptable widget (at a glance). Everything is works fine and it has openwrather api like every other weather widget.
I just to replace it with any other weather api like accuweather or dark sky.
I can not simply change just the api and I am not pro script writer.
Can you make one with accuweather api?
I can share the code with you with the existing openweather api.

Changing Background related to parameter change possible?
Hey all,

I was able to adapt the Tempest Weatherflow Scriptable with "transparent" Background and also add some additional parameters to show.

Now I was thinking how to get dynamic background related to the weather outside (sunny picture, cloudy picture, rainy/snowy picture). Is there a way point out to different background pictures in relation to a parameter (e.g solar radiation)

&#x200B;

Actually I am doing the background transparent like this:

let fm = FileManager.iCloud()

let path = fm.documentsDirectory() + "/Pictures/image.jpg";

w.backgroundImage = fm.readImage(path);

&#x200B;

all informations are in my older post [https://www.reddit.com/r/Scriptable/comments/k5u1lb/weatherflow\_widget\_tempest\_weather\_station/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scriptable/comments/k5u1lb/weatherflow_widget_tempest_weather_station/)

I’m a developer IRL and I’m familiar with Widgy (for widgets) or shortcuts (for little “code”).

I would love to use Scriptable but I don’t see the point of it... there are the 2 apps I mentioned for each domains that scriptable does... 

Can anyone explain me why do you use this app for ? And how (I guess it’s awful to code on an iPhone...)

This is a great post that describes how you can implement a source code editor for iOS. Most of the technologies mentioned in the post are the same I use in Scriptable, eg. Highlightr and Tern. These days I’m trying to rewrite the editor to use Tree-sitter instead of Highlightr. https://t.co/lihGrOW4Bm

# New Feature & Changes!

* From now, Pixel Widget and Pixel Launcher is released in the same version.
* Introducing new **auto mode** in wallpaper setting, which allow you to automatically change the wallpaper based on device's appearance (Light / Dark mode)  
 (Since iOS doesn't let widgets to detect screen mode, so you have to run  widget in Scriptable app at least once to apply changes.)  
 Surely, you can also set it **fixed** mode to set a single wallpaper in your widget!
* and, It also has improvements in selecting Wallpaper! Now, you can set your wallpaper **without** setting File Bookmarks. then, you can choose them using fancy DocumentPicker. Isn't it **cool**, right?
* Take a look, please! When you're setting wallpaper, you have to move  your target wallpaper to iCloud - Scriptable Folder! or you might  experience black wallpaper in widget view.  
 
* also tiny improvements on the way! new features like changing widget's refresh rate, hiding event view or battery icon, or taking cat pictures! **(It's a joke, don't take it seriously)**
* Meet the new Pixel Launcher! Improved UI will make you feel **so good**

&#x200B;

* Here's the highlights! you can now setup **plugins** from Pixel Launcher!  
 We've prepared Mini Memo, and Mini Day Counter component! (and COVID-19 information for Korea)
* Many plugins will be added in future update, so stay tuned!
* Pixel Widget Pro will be available in Early january, so please wait a bit.

&#x200B;

* Thanks for using Pixel Widget, and **Happy New Year!** 🌈

These lines of code take 10 seconds to execute and isScrollEnabled = false is the culprit 🧐

My text editor is too slow when highlighting large documents. Currently testing with a 3.5MB JSON document. I think I’ll need to highlight  the document in “batches”, maybe as the user scrolls the UITextView. Not sure how to go about that 🤔 Tips and tricks are much appreciated.

In comparison @Textastic opens the file in the blink of an eye and it takes my editor several seconds. If you're building a text editor, you really want to compare it to Textastic. It's so fast at everything. https://t.co/mkIblwgLn5

[Release] Upcoming Calendar Indicator
I have just posted an update to v1.3 for Upcoming Calendar Indicator. 

You can see detailed information and grab the code from [here](https://github.com/mvan231/Scriptable/tree/main/Upcoming%20Calendar%20Indicator)

**New as of v1.3, there is now a set of questions on the first run to get things setup for you before displaying in a widget. The questions to be answered are for:**     

    [Dynamic Spacing and Monday as first day of week](https://i.imgur.com/ZTMxt3g.jpg)
        
    * Dynamic spacing of the event list

    * Using Monday as the start of the week in the month view on the right side
        
    [Color background and no-background](https://i.imgur.com/cdCuM29.jpg)
    * Ability to use a different background color of the widget view than the standard white/black

    * Utilization of the no-background.js transparency module from supermamon (link is in my main Scriptable page)
        
    [All Day events and shadow enable](https://i.imgur.com/5JEuCHe.jpg)
    * Ability to show "All Day" events that are occurring today or not (default behavior for this previously was to not show them)
  
    * Ability to show a shadow color under the event name in the event list. The color of the shadow is customizable in the next step. 

    [Shadow color pick for light and dark modes](https://i.imgur.com/hYEjkmo.jpg)
    * If you choose "Yes" to have a shadow color, you will be asked to choose the color of the shadow for the light and dark mode appearances. This extra customization helps with different background colors and photos for better readability. 

    [Background color entry and event font size](https://i.imgur.com/K1cBxB9.jpg)
    * If you chose "Yes" to utilizing a different background color for the widget, you will be asked to enter the hex color for the background to display.
      
    * Event list font size choice between Normal, Small, and Large
 
    [Calendar Ignore and prompt](https://i.imgur.com/a7q2AOU.jpg)
    * You will be asked if you would like to EXCLUDE any calendars from the widget, ...

I'm a bit behind with my podcasts, and I'm just now listening to @_upgradefm's 2020 Upgradies. I was very pleasantly surprised to hear @jsnell mention Scriptable in the context of "Best Overall iOS App" 😃

Spoiler alert: It didn't win. But still very heartwarming ☺️ https://t.co/Kw5rfQJUDH

Thanks for all the answers. My GF and I were discussing average commuting times and I got curious how it actually looked like. Now, I didn’t actually compute the average but it’s clear that people are commuting more than I thought, and unsurprisingly, more in bigger countries. https://t.co/fkr77bNgT1

If anyone could tell me which of this is mine, I would love that. My iphone says it´s  **1.334 by750 pixels with 326 p/p** 

Sorry if it´s a dumb question. Thanks in advance.

I created an iOS Widget with @scriptableapp to display recent news from The Verge. You can grab it for free with a manual that explains how to install it. If you’d like to build your own widget, I created a 22 page tutorial that you can buy for a few $ https://t.co/HDmX75KLRn

Take image from input and crop it
I’m trying to make a script that takes an image input into it and will crop it to a small, medium, or large widget in the location chosen in it’s preferences.

The idea is that I’ll have a shortcut that blurs the image, sets it as my wallpaper, passes the not blurred image into the script, the script sets the widget to the wallpaper section, and then the shortcut refreshes my scriptable widgets. I could then have my wallpaper change whenI charge my phone and maintain a blank widget.

Like I said, I’m trying, but having little to no luck. Any help would be appreciated.

A plain UITextView with no fancy things going on has a poor performance when deleting characters from a big string. Notice how the delete key stays highlighted for a while because the main thread is hanging. This feels like a deal breaker for my editor right now 😞 https://t.co/ZgfGXfsS1r

How crazy would it be to make a custom text view that conforms to UITextInput? 😬

I struggle to find other solutions to the remaining performance problems in my text editor, but I'm sure it'll entail plenty of new problems as well.

Timestampe to individual time format
Hi,

i am about to learn JS and Scriptable is perfect for learning right now. I just created a widget that shows my energy consumption at home provided by a json file.

But I am struggling with the dateFormatter. I like to convert a timestamp to a format like "DD.MM.YY - h:mm". How can I do this with scriptable?

I thought I can just the function like `let newTime = dateFormat(aTimestamp, "YYYY-MM-DD")` , but that das not work.

I appreciate your help!

Sebastian

Just released Jayson 1.4.1 for macOS. It should fix an issue that caused the app to often crash on Big Sur.

I’m (slowly) working on Jayson 2.0, which should provide a better experience across all platforms. In fact that update is part of the reason I’m working on a text editor.

Widget design
As a JS and Scriptable "newbie", I am looking for a overview of different design and align elements that effect the position of each Text or image.  
Some are just using list-elements, other use "addStack". Is the stack like a "div" container? I would like to create a medium widget, with Text on the left and a graph on the right side? So I assume I should use the Stack elements?

kind regards

Sebastian

After seeing the delightful news that Apollo and Carrot Weather just earned Editor’s Choice (🎉!), I was curious about what other apps have received that honor.  A bit of rough scripting around later it looks like 382 in total, the majority of them games.  https://t.co/PUwTBBco5d

I’d love to see the Developer Tools category represented in this spreadsheet.

I’m not saying that my apps should get the Editor’s Choice award. I would *love* it, but that’s not what I’m saying. I want Apple to acknowledge that the App Store contains great tools for developers. https://t.co/ONw4NJp8Sf

Make a url from html code
Hi

I have some html code in scriptable, see below:

let strHTMLOriginal = `<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
  </head>
<body>
  <form>
    <input id="field1" value="one" /><br>
    <input id="field2" value="two" />
    <input type="submit" id="submit" value="Submit">
  </form>
</body>
</html>`

I would like to 

I would like to be able to view this in Safari, see below code (Taken from the ‘Is Slack down example’):

let url = "https://status.slack.com"
let r = new Request(url)
let body = await r.loadString()
Safari.openInApp(url) 

I somehow need to do this but obviously this won’t work but how can I do it?

let url = "strHTMLOriginal" 

I know I can do it in web view but I just don’t like the look.

Hi

Is it possible to convert html code in Scriptable to render in a full screen web app without the address bar?

I simply want to create a form where I can say ‘hey Siri, add a new customer’ and it brings up the form in the style and format I want.

I’ve gone around the blocks but I can’t seem to find an answer, personally I don’t think it’s possible but I want clarification.

Using Combine with URLSession.DataTaskPublisher and I really find the sink(receiveCompletion:receiveValue:) API awkward.

Do I need think of my network requests as streams of events?

I'm new to the reactive world and Combine in particular, so I'm probably missing something.

Open Kiosker from Scriptable
Hi

I’ve just downloaded an App called Kiosker.io which is a full screen Browser, it also allows me to use a local file.

Could scriptable open Kiosker? It looks as though iOS Shortcuts won’t so I have to rule that out.

I would like to say “Hey Siri, create a new client” which would run a script which consists of a form. Once the form has been submitted, it would continue with the script

Is this possible with Scriptable and if so how could this be done?

[HELP] Widget design
Hi everyone.

I want to create a widget that displays my personal finance data that i pull from google sheets, and i'm at a pretty good point i miss just one thing from a design stand point.

I want to draw a rectangle as shown in [this image](https://i.imgur.com/rO5t5or.png), but i don't know how to use the "addRect()" function; i believe it's the right function to use.

This is what i've done so far. ([image](https://i.imgur.com/YQJLVvh.jpg))

If anyone can help me with the code i would be very happy.

P.S. all the data on the widget are each in a Stack element (total of 6 Stacks); i guess that the rectangle could be added as an element of a Stack.

How do I scrape Gold Price from a website?
I assume this is easy but I'm trying to build a widget that tells me a live gold price. I have absolutely no experience with Javascript. All my coding is with VB macros.

I can see the price of gold (and other metals) is on line 688 [of this website](view-source:https://www.jmbullion.com/charts/gold-price/) and on line 160 [on this website](view-source:https://www.abcbullion.com.au/).

&nbsp;

I'm sure I could work out the next parts of my plan (refresh every 5 minutes, compare to previous and show either an up or down arrow) but the actual price will be a good start for me. Once I get that I will teach myself to do the rest.

&nbsp;

topAlignContent does not work for me
Hi,

I am struggling with the "topAlignContent()" function. I like to see the "firstRow" on the top of the widget, but it is centred every time. Where is my error?

&#x200B;

Thank you!

    
    class Configuration {
    	textColorDark = "80BD9e"
    }
    
    let CONFIGURATION = new Configuration();
    
    
    const widget = await createWidget()
    	widget.backgroundColor = new Color("777777")
    if (!config.runsInWidget) {
    	 await widget.presentSmall()
    }
    
    Script.setWidget(widget);
    Script.complete();
    
    
    async function createWidget() {
    
        let list = new ListWidget()
    
    		list.setPadding(0, 0, 0, 0)
    
    	    let firstRow = list.addStack()
    	    let secondRow = list.addStack()
    	
    	
    	firstRow.setPadding(0, 0, 0, 0)
    	firstRow.layoutHorizontally()
    	firstRow.topAlignContent()

    	dataBlock(firstRow,"Energie", "0815W")
    
    
    	// SECOND ROW /////////////////////////
    secondRow.addText("SECOND ROW")
    
    
    	return list;
    }
    
    
    function dataBlock(contentLocation,labelText,contentText) {
    	let itemStack = contentLocation.addStack()
    	itemStack.layoutVertically()
    	//itemStack.topAlignContent()
    	
    	let upperLabel = itemStack.addText(labelText)
    	itemStack.addSpacer(2);
    	let theData = itemStack.addText(contentText)
    	itemStack.addSpacer(2);

There are two types of iOS developers: Those who enable bezels in their simulator and those who don’t.

I never understood the point of them. Extra screen real estate for me, thanks.

Automate ScriptDude?
I used ScriptDude to install most of my scripts/widgets. My Homebridge Status widget will automatically notify me if there is an update to any of my Homebridge plugins or node.js, etc. Is there a way to do the same with ScriptDude and have it alert me if any of my scripts have updates (as opposed to manually checking for updates every day)? Or, possibly a way to use the Shortcuts app to check for updates, which can then be automated?

First stab at putting together a @scriptableapp widget for skiing. Works internationally, just gotta plug in the lat & long of your favorite ski area or let the widget find the one closest to you. And it gives you beer (icons) after lifts close!

Random quotes widget
First post here and I only discovered Scriptable a week ago, developer by trade so I decided it was time to start diving into the development of scripts, working on a few things right now but here is a simple one I built to replace the "Motivation" app on my phone. Don't get me wrong it is a great app, but it's nice to be able to replace it with something much lighter! Here is what it looks like, I'll get onto transparency once I have mastered Scriptable a bit more!

Here is the link to the gist: [https://gist.github.com/blacksector/2ef094ff9035b12db7f25d14bac9f465](https://gist.github.com/blacksector/2ef094ff9035b12db7f25d14bac9f465)

Getting sensor data from WebView
I've been trying to get sensor data (specifically the compass or gyroscope) for ages now, and still haven't been able to do so. I've tried both Scriptable and Siri Shortcuts, but neither work for this purpose.

&#x200B;

window.DeviceOrientationEvent isn't accessible from a data URL, so thats out of the question. 

Opening a new tab or running the javascript code on a secure website doesn't seem to work either (the code runs, but for some reason the eventListener doesn't trigger)

&#x200B;

Here is my code (NOTE: once the event listener fires, the code is different. This just prints something *if the listener fires,* which it doesn't.)

`let wv = new WebView(); await wv.waitForLoad(); await wv.evaluateJavaScript("window.addEventListener('deviceorientation',function(e){console.log('the listener is working.');})")`

[Release] Upcoming Calendar Indicator v1.5
I've made some improvements and new implementations based on some various feedback I have received both here in the sub and also on GitHub and Discord. 

New changes are:
- add in reminder support
- add in setup question for reminder support
- add option during setup for displaying the calendar color in the event list
- reminder emoji added to reminder title
- reminder list color added to display text color
- adjust current date indicator font size to better align with the other dates
- add in AM/PM indicator to the date shown in event list
- add ability to change the base text color between for each mode (light/dark)
- add setting for 24hr time vs 12hr for event list


An example of what v1.5 could look like with the new base color changes is like [this image](https://i.imgur.com/CORi5YL.jpg). This is utilizing base text color changed to red and the 24 hour time format. 

As before, you can see information and get the script from [here on my GitHub](https://github.com/mvan231/Scriptable/tree/main/Upcoming%20Calendar%20Indicator)

Adapt ‘Vaccination Tracker’ for multiple countries
https://gist.github.com/mattsson/16d512c29e2939fdb69d5e2423e954a8

Found this amazing vaccination tracker (see link) - however I’d like to track these stats for multiple countries. 

I tried to create different scripts for each country but the widgets all show the same result. I suspect it has something to do with the caching. 

Any idea how to make these scripts standalone so I can run multiple?

Thank you.

Transparent widget not working
Hi!
Feels like I’ve tried about everything, including looking at a bunch of examples, but I can’t get it right. 
My widget refuses to become transparent. I’m probably missing something obvious 😁
Other transparent widgets work, so no problem with no-background.js but most likely my crappy coding. 
Anyone? 😅

Can anyone help me with overlaying images on top of each other.
I’m fairly new to Scriptable, and I am trying to write a script that fetches data from a website, processes that data, and then shows me an image as the output. I have most of it completed so far.

All I have left to do is get the image files, (the images are completely transparent other than a small area) and then overlay them onto a ‘main’ image. This is the part I cannot figure out how to do.

If anyone can help me out with this, it would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance.

Design help for F1 widget
I am making a widget for F1 upcoming races. I have the base code almost ready and looking at themes. I suck at design and colours and layout and well anything UI based.

Here is what I have so far:

https://i.imgur.com/r5ZgdjS.jpg

Have the race title, track and then the race time followed by the next race element (FP1-3 and quali), the track and overlaid if it is not yet confirmed.

Theme colours are for the teams (three shown). Looking for help on colours (I.e. Ferrari probably should be red background etc). The content and anything additional to display.

Otherwise I should have something by end of week with improvements after that.

So apparently App Transport Security can now (since when?) do SSL pinning natively, but the only “documentation” is this post on the developer app/website, and the relevant Info.plist keys are in an image, so they won’t show up on Google 😅 https://t.co/ZuPdeQWxdd

Anyone know of a way to convert between byte indices and code units in an NSString or Swift string?

As an example the 🥳 emoji takes up 4 bytes but 2 code units. Pairs of two bytes make up a code unit in this case.

Hi everyone,

I'm tryng to recreate the [Apple Battery widget](https://m.imgur.com/6eEqowK).

I have two questions:

1. How to achieve that translucent look that looks so cool
2. How to add custom icon or images at the center of the rings

So far i've done pretty much all the design except these two things ([my design](https://i.imgur.com/UV7hDlW.png))

Thank you

HELP with drawArc function
Hi everyone,

I have a logo as shown in this [image](https://m.imgur.com/0Fze3Pz) and I want to put it inside the red ring instead of the text, but I think that I have to modify the function in order to do it. The problem is that i don't know how to do it.

Anyone more skilled than me as a solution?

Here's the code ([this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scriptable/comments/jfzia0/circles_date_and_battery_widget_medium/) is my reference for this code)

    const canvWidth = 21; //Circle thickness
    const canvRadius = 87; //Circle radius
    
    canvas.size = new Size(canvSize, canvSize);
    canvas.respectScreenScale = true;
    
    function sinDeg(deg) {
      return Math.sin((deg * Math.PI) / 180);
    }
    
    function cosDeg(deg) {
      return Math.cos((deg * Math.PI) / 180);
    }
    
    function drawArc(deg, fillColor, strokeColor, txtColor, text, label) {
      let ctr = new Point(canvSize / 2, canvSize / 2),
      bgx = ctr.x - canvRadius;
      bgy = ctr.y - canvRadius;
      bgd = 2 * canvRadius;
      bgr = new Rect(bgx, bgy, bgd, bgd);
      
      // canvas.opaque = false;
    
      canvas.setFillColor(fillColor);
      canvas.setStrokeColor(strokeColor);
      canvas.setLineWidth(canvWidth);
      canvas.strokeEllipse(bgr);
    
      for (t = 0; t < deg; t++) {
        rect_x = ctr.x + canvRadius * sinDeg(t) - canvWidth / 2;
        rect_y = ctr.y - canvRadius * cosDeg(t) - canvWidth / 2;
        rect_r = new Rect(rect_x, rect_y, canvWidth, canvWidth);
        canvas.fillEllipse(rect_r);
      }
      // attempt to draw info text
      const canvTextRect = new Rect(
        0,
        100 - canvTextSize / 2,

Stoped working in both my phone and iPad! 
Haven’t made any changes to the scripts, tried updating code. 

Getting an error that says “data is in the wrong format”? 

Other scripts work fine.

Just made Scriptable widget to show Session DAU on home screen. It's coded entirely in JavaScript. The data refreshed every 6-11 minutes (default by iOS) via https://t.co/Jg6b8CrUeX. 

Damn this is so handy. Apple widget and Shortcuts are a game changer.

Weather Cal medium widget possible?
Hi Scriptable geniuses, is there a way to edit Weather Cal widget in such a way to remove Events section so that the widget size is medium? Help much appreciated.

The performance of my text editor is fine for what I need now. Here I’m opening a 26 MB file, highlighting it and editing a few lines.

I’m happy as long as editing relatively big files like that works. Then I know it’ll handle more common file sizes (a few MBs) with no problems. https://t.co/cuUCA55WaG

Design - getting the stacks to the right place?
Hey!
Been working on this for a while.
Getting stuff from a google sheet and show the results in tables.
It should be
Label 1 Data 1
Label 2 Data 2
Etc

But it’s like the more I try to fix it the worse it becomes 😂
Tried wrapping the stacks in new stacks after reading about it here, but that was too hard for my brain to handle. It’s starting to become inception level stacking 😁

IF wrapping the stacks in new stacks and placing them in somewhat reasonable places throughout the (large) widget is the way to go, could someone please show me an example? 😁

Ignore the weird colors, I’m just using it as visual aid atm

Run script in safari webpage
Hi,

I would like to make a script which can open a specific website and press a button there. I have already made a JavaScript script to press that button, but then I realized I can’t do that exactly via Siri Shortcuts. So I switched to Scriptable.

Here is my question, how do I do that with Scriptable?

I have the code which will press the button on the website, but how do I get there in the first place? I’m sorry if this is elementary but I have zero experience with JavaScript (but I want to learn).

Google Maps Covid-19 Layer
Since the Google Maps app has a Covid-19 layer, could we use that information to make widget for any country or even states of countries. 

If so, could this be one customizable widget? Just add a place and done! Maybe?

**Edit:** apparently Google gets the data from the [John Hopkins University ](https://blog.google/products/maps/navigate-safely-new-covid-data-google-maps/amp/). Still could we use this data to make a customizable widget?

But since jan. 22 it shows the 'source' of the (Dutch) data instead of the actual numbers. I think it has something to do with the 'vaccine' column displaying multiple vaccin brands since that date:  [https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/blob/master/public/data/vaccinations/country\_data/Netherlands.csv](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/blob/master/public/data/vaccinations/country_data/Netherlands.csv) 

Can anyone help me fix this?

I can't figure it out myself but love to keep track of the vaccination stats!

Shortcuts actions that use the new in-app intent handling can run while the device is locked in iOS 14.4. This is great!

Especially because I’ve received *so many* support mails about it not working in Scriptable since iOS 14 was released.

Simple (I think) question - iCloud image file path
Hi, first time here, new to scriptable (and I don’t code in js usually...)

I want to create a widget that will simply display a specific image from my iCloud Drive, I will then occasionally replace the image with a new one - and rename it so it will load. 

The problem is I don’t know how to specify the file path name for the image and I don’t want to use bookmarked paths (is this a mistake?). 

also, assume I don’t want it in the scriptable folder. 

Appreciate the help.

LSWeather - Fully Automated
Sorry for back to back post on this script. 


Check the original post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scriptable/comments/l62ecr/lsweather_v20/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

I have now managed to completely automate this script to run with Automation. So now you can create and use different layouts at different hours. 

Script: [LSWeather](https://github.com/ajatkj/scriptable)

Shortcut: [LSWeather](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/1e99eca2edb0418fb1ad6ee9ccf1312d)

Please read the installation and configuration instructions on the GitHub page. 

Any feedback/criticism welcomed.

Help querying reminders...
Hi! So this works: 

`let reminders = await Reminder.allIncomplete()`

`for (reminder of reminders) {`

`if (reminder.title.includes("@pos")) {`

		`log(reminder.title)`

		`log(reminder.notes)`

`}`

`}`

&#x200B;

but this doesn't: 

`let reminders = await Reminder.allIncomplete()`

`for (reminder of reminders) {`

`if (reminder.notes.includes("#inprogress(reading)")) {`

		`log(reminder.title)`

		`log(reminder.notes)`

`}`

`}`

&#x200B;

The latter code simply swaps reminder.title.includes() for reminder.notes.includes(), but gives me a `undefined is not an object (evaluating 'reminder.notes.includes')` even though I can see that the string I'm searching for is present in the notes of an incomplete reminder. Anything I'm doing wrong?

The latest TestFlight build have expired. There will be new builds in the future, but I need some more time for development.

For now you can use the App Store version of the app. It’ll override the TestFlight build and keep all your data intact.

Often when I write simple views in SwiftUI, I get a ton of auto layout warnings in the console. Is this normal? I can't really see what I should be doing differently.

[Release] COVID Trend Widget
## Welcome to COVID Trend Widget ##

You can get it from [here](https://github.com/mvan231/Scriptable/tree/main/COVID%20Trend%20Widget)

This widget will display country level stats for COVID-19 and also display a trending indicator whether the given item is trending up, down, or steady. 

The default setting has colored arrows enabled (green for good and red for bad). You can disable this by setting the colorArrows variabke, to false.

The API used comes from Javier Aviles at [this link](https://github.com/javieraviles/covidAPI) which was formed from the [disease.sh repo](https://github.com/disease-sh/API). 

This widget caches data in the Scriptable iCloud Drive folder for comparison to the latest data grabbed from the api.

To setup the widget enter the country name in the widget parameter.

**Note:** If the country name doesn't work, make sure it is a valid country name by visiting [this page](https://coronavirus-19-api.herokuapp.com/tabs/tab2) and find the country by name and use that in the parameter.

##### Setup Image #####
[setup](https://i.imgur.com/wCGFY0d.png)

##### Example Images #####
[Example1 - with colors](https://i.imgur.com/ISs6Hgi.jpg)

[Example2 - without colors](https://i.imgur.com/2zE7Mqu.jpg)

##### Update Image #####
If an update is made to the code, you'll be shown in the widget and can run the widget in app to be taken to the GitHub page.

Small Calendar Widget
So, I'm searching for a compact widget that displays chosen calendars. What I want:
-	A **small** widget that
-	displays a **list** of the next upcoming events (maybe up to 6?), timespan max 14 days, with its time (beginning and ending)
-	each event should be displayed in the **colors of the calendar** it belongs to
-	each first event of a **new day** should have an abbreviation of the day in front of the name
-	and this one would be awesome: a SFsymbol behind each title with the **weather** forecast ☀️🌤🌧🌩🌨 of the day (or even the place of the event, if possible) - but as I'm aware of the complexity of the code, this would be awesome but facultative.

Anyone aware of any widget achieving at least parts of these criteria? I did not find anything like this yet, and am unfortunately not good enough with JavaScript to achieve this project on my own.

Help and hints are appreciated as any search of my own (on [automators.fm](https://talk.automators.fm/c/scriptable/13), this subreddit, or the Discord channel https://discord.gg/7KbjfTV and other websites) was futile 😔

Thanks a lot, take care and stay safe!!!!

Does anyone know of or have a script that measures the time from plug in to fully charged and shows the total time it takes to fully charge the iPhone?
I would like to know if it can be done via a script and have the information stored in a Battery Log file in iCloud with the initial charge time, the initial charge percentage and the final 100% charge time and calculate the difference between these two times to have the total time it takes to charge.

It would be necessary to create two automations to run the script when it is connected and another for when it reaches 100%.

If anyone can do this or can share it it would help me a lot because I need it to do charging time testing of various wireless chargers.

Please help

Seeing performance issues when disabling line wrapping and laying out very long lines in my text editor. Each line is a CATextLayer. Setting a long string on those seems too expensive. Not sure how to go about that. Could be that I should play around with NSLayoutManager again 🤔

Struggling to find a performant way to draw *very* long lines with TextKit or Core Text when not wrapping lines, meaning horizontal scrolling is enabled.

NSLayoutManager's -glyphRange(forBoundingRect:in:) seem to return the glyph range for an entire line.

Anyone got any ideas?

Url scheme launch VERY slow
Hi!
Been playing around some with launching apps from a widget, but some of them launches super slow.
If the app is running in background it’s fast.
If I start the app the usual way it’s fast.
If the app isn’t running in the background it gets stuck on the apps load screen for like 10-20 seconds until it starts when I launch from scriptable.
It’s weird since Scriptable immediately tries to launch the app but the app itself takes forever 🤷‍♂️
iPhone 12Pro.
Any ideas?

URL scheme to add script.
I saw that there is the url scheme „scriptable:///add“.
Is this only to add an empty new script or can you also use it to add a new filled script.

Something like this:
scriptable:///add?script=helloworld

Really wish I could customize the time of day that the calendar widget start showing events for the next day. I’m done working for today. Don’t wanna stress about tomorrow already.

That said, I’m really happy with this widget. I glance at it *many* times a day.

Help! Writing image to file path...
I have this: 

`const fileManager = FileManager.iCloud()`

`const dataPath = fileManager.documentsDirectory() + "/rando_unsplash.jpeg"`

`fileManager.writeImage(dataPath, img)`

(full script here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Scriptable/comments/lf2n5l/random\_image\_widget\_from\_url/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scriptable/comments/lf2n5l/random_image_widget_from_url/))

I thought this would overwrite the file that's created and so serve as a temporary cache, but currently it produces a new (numbered) file each time. Is there anything I've overlooked? 

Alternatively, is there any better way to create a temporary cached image file that I can access (for the purpose of running a Google image search for more details about the image) that only persists until the next time the script runs?

Thanks!

Request() handled differently when run in widget
In my script I am trying to fetch data from `https://www.instagram.com/<username>/?__a=1`. It should return a json containing information about the specified profile. And that is what it does... at least when I run it inside the app. When it is run from the widget I get the HTML of instagram's login page.
I don't know if this is some kind of bug, or intended, or whatever. Does anyone have a solution for me.

NOTE: When run inside the app or the widget, exactly the same code is used to fetch the data.

Working on JSX Widget Parser
Since I'm a big fan of React, and creating widgets is very exhausting this way, I got an idea to create something like JSX widget helper for Scriptable. This is still work in progress, but I would love to get some feedback, or even some help if someone with good JavaScript skills is interested.

Who knows, maybe event Simon like this idea, and give us official support for this.

For now i've added support for Stack, Spacer and Text. I'm gonna work on Images next, and adding more props to to existing components.

Anyway, here is [screenshot](https://imgur.com/gallery/9ZvcaZX), and the [gist link](https://gist.github.com/bsehovac/e8fd512bb89ea51fb1ae5ab5a19bdc3a).

As you can see, this is the how the widget is constructed:

    widgetJSX(`
      <Widget size="small" color="#1B1B1B" padding="10 10 10 10">
        <Stack layout="vertical">
          <Stack layout="horizontal">
            <Spacer />
            <Text string="Hello World" />
            <Spacer />
          </Stack>
          <Spacer length="5" />
          <Stack layout="horizontal">
            <Spacer />
              <Text string="Scriptable JSX Widget v0.1" size="14" color="#AAAAAA" />
            <Spacer />
          </Stack>
        </Stack>
      </Widget>
    `)

All HTTP requests made have a Content-Length of 0
How can I set the `Content-Length` header to the proper value?

The default is set to 0.

Even when I try manually overriding it in the `Request.headers`, the actual headers remain `0`. I verified this by seeing the request in [mitmproxy](https://mitmproxy.org/).

I am trying to automate an API with Siri, but if the `Content-Length` headers are not set properly, AWS Cloudfront automatically returns a `500` response.

Hi, im new to Scriptable and this question may sound dumb, but i couldnt find any other way to troubleshoot this issue (Scriptable's community is relatively small compared to Shortcuts).

I would like to list all the files in a directory, and this is my code so far:

    let a = FileManager.iCloud();
    const path = "/Shortcuts/"
    a.listContents(path)

But for some reason I keep getting this error:

    2021-02-14 16:01:14: Error on line 3:15: The folder “Shortcuts” doesn’t exist.
    

Please help point out whats wrong with my code, any help is appreciated. Thanks!

Pretty happy about using Combine this way. -login(email:password:) on SessionController returns a Publisher. We use our -receiveResult(:) to treat it as a simple promise and then return the result to our view controller using a good ol' delegate pattern.

If you're using Combine and your code doesn't compile, it's because you're not calling eraseToAnyPublisher() enough.

New ‘Mobile Charge Mode’ in iOS 14.5 beta 2 for an as-yet-unannounced ‘Battery Pack’ and not a case presumedly because it uses MagSafe for charging iPhone 12 devices. Also interestingly it keeps your iPhone charged to 90% for ‘battery efficiency’. https://t.co/CPZXkBXkEc

I have created a widget to display instagram stats, images or follower growth over time. It is still in beta, but it works fine.

You can find the code and instructions to install the widget on my [GitHub](https://github.com/wiebecommajonas/instagram-widget).

A few examples:

The last version of the script kept getting the "The data couldn't be read because it isn't in the correct format" error.  This update fixes that. 

The update also adds: 
* support for private profiles (as long as you're a follower)
* support for regions restricted before


All this, thanks to [u/jonaswiebe's post](https://reddit.com/r/Scriptable/comments/llpxmv/widget_for_instagram/).

Help with some basic
Hi guys, it's someone out here who could help me?  I would like make a widget that shows the time left to get battery complete and time for 80% so i need put this on a widget

When battery is lower than 80%
 X = 0.7 * 80 - 6
 Y = 0.7 * (current battery level) - 6
 X-Y = A   —->   time left for 80%

H = 3.9 * 100 -240
K = 3.9 * 80-240
(H - K) + A = time left for 100% when battery is lower than 80%

If battery is upper than 80%
G = 3.9 * 100 - 240
D = 3.9 * (current battery level) -240
G-D = time left for 100%

I don’t know how programming this on a widget 😔🥺

Prompt Siri for Current Stock Positions
I've seen some super cool stocks widgets and I was curious if anyone has coded one that prompts Siri to speak your current positions? Obviously, you can just ask for an update on each individual stock, but I was thinking of asking "what's the market like today?" and getting a rundown on my own positions. I'm in the process of coding it, but my java experience is minimal so it's taking a little longer than I'd like.

Widget to show Power Consumption from Shelly
Hi Everyone,

I'm really sorry for such a noob question, but I just don't know where to start and I think, everyone who already worked with scriptable will figure this out in seconds..

I got a [Shelly 1PM](https://shelly.cloud/products/shelly-1pm-smart-home-automation-relay/) which measures the power consumption of the device you connect. They have API access and when I poll the Shelly I get results in the following format:

    {"isok":true,"data":{"online":true,"device_status":{"ext_temperature":[],"mac":"xxxxxxxx","relays":[{"ison":true,"has_timer":false,"timer_started":0,"timer_duration":0,"timer_remaining":0,"overpower":false,"source":"input"}],"temperature":27.38,"uptime":74355,"ram_free":37512,"unixtime":1613893903,"serial":1234,"mqtt":{"connected":false},"overtemperature":false,"fs_free":143070,"has_update":false,"update":{"status":"idle","has_update":false,"new_version":"20210115-103820\/v1.9.4@e2732e05","old_version":"20210115-103820\/v1.9.4@e2732e05","beta_version":"20210209-101904\/v1.10.0-rc2-g0cf9ee3-heads\/v1.10.0-rc2"},"inputs":[{"input":0,"event":"","event_cnt":0}],"cloud":{"enabled":true,"connected":true},"tmp":{"tC":27.38,"tF":81.28,"is_valid":true},"temperature_status":"Normal","ram_total":50296,"ext_sensors":[],"fs_size":233681,"cfg_changed_cnt":1,"ext_humidity":[],"time":"09:05","meters":[{"power":25.54,"overpower":0,"is_valid":true,"timestamp":1613898384,"counters":[24.14,22.976,23.27],"total":39138}],"_updated":"2021-02-21 08:06:23","actions_stats":{"skipped":0},"getinfo":{"fw_info":{"device":"shelly1pm-xxxxxxxx","fw":"20210115-103820\/v1.9.4@e2732e05"}},"wifi_sta":{"connected":true,"ssid":"xxxxxx","ip":"xxxxxx","rssi":-53}}}}

How can I use this output to create a Scriptable Widget which shows me the Power Consumption? The value we need for this is **"power":25.54"** \- This is the current consumption in watt, so in this case 25.54 watts.

I appreciate any help with this. Thanks a lot!

Any body know of any timetable widgets on scriptable?
Hi! I started going back to school after online learning and was wondering if anybody knew any timetable widget for my Home Screen. I am still fairly new to scriptable but I have started. If you have any widgets you know of please link them in the comments. Thanks 😁🙃🙂

Beginners guide to requests
[Documentation](https://docs.scriptable.app/request/)
This is a guide on how to make requests.

**Basic Code**
This code performs a simple GET request for a specified url.
```
const url = 'https://req.uest/url'
var req = new Request(url)
var result = await req.loadJSON()
```

Alternatively, if your api does not return the JSON format, you can use `load()` or `loadString()`.

**Method**
You can use different [methods](https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods) for your request depending on your needs. The common methods are `GET` and `POST`.

*Example*
```
req.method = 'GET'
```

**Headers**
Headers are typically used to provide api keys, but they are not restricted to this.

*Example*
```
req.headers = {
  'api-key': '845a5e77f37404d6ffd41bccf9b926be0cf1e3431707'
}
```

*Note*
Similarly, you can provide a body: `req.body = {...}`

**Response**
If you want to check whether the request succeeded or not, you can check the response for error messages or codes (code 200 means success).

*Example*
```
console.log(req.response)
```

*Note*
`response` has a value other than `undefined` only after the request is made.

**Parameters**
Parameters are added via the URL. The first parameter is preceded by a question mark `?`. The following parameters are each preceded by an ampersand `&`. The format of the parameters is `parameter=value`.

*Example*
```
const url = 'https://req.uest/url?first%20parameter=abc&second%20parameter=876'
```

*Note*
Parameters need to be URL encoded. That means that characters like spaces cannot be written as ` `. They need to be encoded (a space would be `%20`).

**Form data**
Form data cannot be added to the url itself. You can different types of form data using one of the following functions (which are part of the  [Request](https://docs.scriptable.app/request/) type):
```
addFileDataToMultipart(data, mimeType, name, filename)
addFileToMultipart(filePath, name, filename)
addImageToMultipart(image, name, filename)
addParameterToMultipart(name, value)
```

*Example*
```
req.addPara...

https://www.reddit.com/r/Scriptable/comments/lq1vb9/a_beginners_guide_to_widgets/
A Beginner's Guide to Widgets
Also check the [documentation](https://docs.scriptable.app/listwidget/)

## Basics
To create a widget you need to create a new ListWidget object:
```
var widget = new ListWidget()
```
Although this creates a widget object, this does not display anything. To display the currently empty widget
```
Script.setWidget(widget)
```
must be called. *Typically, you will want to put this at the very end of your script.*
### Viewing the widget on your home screen
To see the widget, got to your home screen and add a new Scriptable widget. Now you need to select the correct script. You will see (depending on whether you have dark mode enabled or not) a white or black widget.
### Viewing the widget inside the editor
To view the widget inside the editor, use the functions `presentSmall()`, `presentMedium()` and `presentLarge()`.
#### Example
```
if (config.runsInApp) widget.presentSmall()
else if (config.runsInWidget) Script.setWidget(widget)
```
## Layout
### Stacks
To add a new row or column to your widget you can call the function `addStack()`. The layout of the stack can be configured to be horizontal (row) or vertical (column). The default layout is horizontal.
#### Example
This example code creates a column with 5 rows in it.
```
let mainCol = widget.addStack()
mainCol.layoutVertically()
for (i=0; i<5; i++) {
  let row = mainCol.addStack()
  row.layoutHorizontally()
}
```
## Content
### Text
To add a text to a widget stack, use the function `addText(text: string)`. There's really not very much to it.
#### Attributes
You can modify the text by changing the objects attributes:
* text
* font
* textColor
* lineLimit
* [More...](https://docs.scriptable.app/widgettext/)
#### Example
```
var text = row.addText('Hello World!')
text.font = Font.heading()
text.color = new Color('#ff0000') // red
```
### Images
You can add images just like you would add a text. Just use the function `addImage(image: Image)`.
#### Attributes
* image
* imageSize
* cornerRadius
* [More...](https://docs.scriptable.app/widgetimage/)
#### Example
```

How are other @scriptableapp users versioning their scripts?

Up until now I’ve been making copies of my scripts to test ideas but would rather version at some point. 

Do you put the entire Scriptable iCloud folder on git versioning? https://t.co/0Vjra4PbVi

New post on /r/Scriptable
https://www.reddit.com/r/Scriptable/comments/lrroh2/a_beginners_guide_to_json/
A Beginner's Guide to JSON
Okay, this is going to be a short tutorial about accessing JSON values.
## Basic JSON structure
A JSON object can be created like
```
let data = {
  key1: 1,
  'key 2': 'string',
  'key three': false,
  ...
}
```
A key can be any string. If it includes a space or other special characters, it needs to be enclosed by quotation marks. A value can be any other type (also including strings). Entries have to be separated by commas. Some examples of data types would be:
* number
* boolean
* arrays
* another JSON object
## Accessing JSON values
There are two ways to access the value to a specific key in a JSON object.
### Dot notation
When using the dot notation, keys are accessed by preceding the keys name with a dot.
#### Example
```
console.log(data.key1)
// result: 1
```
### Index notation
The index notation is useful when the key you are trying to access contains a space or a similar character. This is similar to accessing indices in arrays.
#### Example
```
console.log(data['key 2'])
// result: 'string'
```
## Looping
To loop through a JSON object, usually the following code is issued:
```
for (let key in data) {
  ...
}
```
* `data`: name of the json object
* `key`: name of variable to store the current keys name
Inside the loop the current key can be used to access the current value like `data[key]`.
## Nested JSON
It is not uncommon to nest JSON objects. I know of two nesting methods. The first would be to just set a key in your JSON object to another JSON object:
```
let data = {
  user: {
    name: 'John Appleseed',
    age: 123456789
  }
}
```
The other method is to set a key to an array containing JSON objects:
```
let data = {
  users: [
    {
      name: 'John Appleseed',
      age: 123456789
    },
    {
      name: 'Jane Appleseed',
      age: 987654321
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```
When dealing with nested JSON objects, accessing the keys and values does not get more difficult. Accessing a users name is as simple as typing `data.user.name` or `data.users[0].name`.
## Useful tool
A tool that is quite handy...

Had to edit a 1000 lines JSON file on my Mac and noticed that the editor had poor performance. Tried editing the same file in my editor for iOS. Super smooth.

In some cases* my editor is faster than popular text editors for Mac.

* Certainly not all but it’s still something ☺️

Stock Widget with Custom Background?
So I am kind of wanting something that looks like apple's stock small widget that has like the name, price, and a little chart or whatever but I want it with a custom image background capability because I would like to make it transparent on my home screen instead of having the grey background that comes with it. Is that something that has been made and if not is that something that someone could make? I have very little experience with coding so this would be difficult for me to do myself.

Update token in Script daily?
I’m working on a widget trying to fetch information from an API that requires a mile long authentication token that needs to be updated daily. The API itself is pretty straightforward except for this Token-idiocy. 

My thoughts are a three-part (maybe two, don’t know yet) widget with Widget code stored in one file, a bunch Of Credentials stored in one file, and lastly the damn Token stored in its own separate file. 

Is this possible? Having a script run in background, without actually being part of the widget, updating its own code/Token and only having that part run once every morning on a set time?

Anyone have an example of a Widget that does this or something similar or how I might get this started? The widget itself is almost done, but I don’t know enough magic to get started on the Token part 😅

Request for notifications based on date
Hello there,

I want Scriptable to send me a notification when a certain date occours (example: every month on the 12th day I want a notification, and when I click the notification Scriptable makes a request to an URL in the background). Is this possible, and if so, can anyone help me with the code?

For reference the link is for sending data to a spreadsheet so the link looks something like this:

As someone who…

✅ Likes Queen
✅ Miss Tap Tap Revenge

…I really like the Queen: Rock Tour game. It’s a good mix of rhythm game and Queen history 🎸🎓

And it’s a single purchase to unlock the full game 💙

Playing with text editors like Nova, Atom and VS Code and examining the codebase of those that are open source to figure out how to do good auto indentation.

*So much* time goes into making my text editor. I hope it’ll be worth it in the end. Nevertheless it’s great fun 😃

Siri needs an “I’m living in a tiny apartment” setting.

Siri’s responses are more verbose when asked to adjust HomeKit devices in other rooms than the room in which a HomePod is located. I live in a tiny apartment and can see most rooms. I don’t need the verbosity.

Copy message sent via applescript on my mac
I have an applescript on my Mac that will text me the external ip address of the router it's "connected" to.  The applescript is triggered by an email I send to myself.  I want to be able to copy the contents of the message I receive to the clipboard on my iphone (just the IP address at this point).  I know shortcuts can't do this but am wondering if there's some way to do it with scriptable.  Or is there a different mechanism to accomplish this?

Hey everyone a few weeks ago I bookmarked a page in here where someone started creating a script for the upcoming f1 season. I saved the original post but couldn’t share it in here, would anyone know if there is a completed version?? I would absolutely love to have that if someone knows if it’s been completed or not. Thank you for the time.

Made some good progress on auto indentation this weekend.

Closing brackets are put on a new line when opening a scope.

It uses a suggested indentation level but respects previous indentation if the user deviates from “standard” indentation.

All based on Tree-sitter. https://t.co/Jijt5vZJ2q

Text with image beside it and more text
I am kind of new to JavaScript and scriptable and was trying to make an easy widget to show levels of battery percentage, volume and brightness. The goal was to have a icon then percent bar and finally the real percent but the text is not being added to the stack. Also sometimes the volume bar will be bigger then the other bars. All help is appreciated.

Code

`widget = new ListWidget()
widget.backgroundColor = new Color("#fff")
Device.batteryLevel()
Device.volume()
Device.screenBrightness()
widgetDesign(Device.batteryLevel(), "⌸")
widgetDesign(Device.volume(), "♒︎")
widgetDesign(Device.screenBrightness(), "☀︎")

function widgetDesign(dec, icon) {
let stack = widget.addStack()
stack.layoutHorizontally()
stack.addText(icon)
let img = new DrawContext()
img.size = new Size(80, 11)
img.setFillColor(new Color("#0000ff"))
let background = new Rect(0, 0, 80, 11)
img.fillRect(background)
img.setFillColor(new Color("fff"))
let width = 79 * dec
let full = new Rect(2, 3, width, 5)
img.fillRect(full)
img = img.getImage()
img = stack.addImage(img)
let persent = dec * 100
stack.addText(persent.toFixed(0) + "%")
}
widget.presentSmall() `

To have more features behind a single button, I’m thinking I’ll need to implement something like the new context menus but wich appears instantly when touching the button. That way users can quickly swipe up to select an action.

Question for the developer of Scriptable!
Is there any reason you can't submit the application to the App Store so that the name of the application doesn't show up on the home screen like Yidget?

Twitter is A/B testing so many things these days and I’m in the group not getting any of the new features. This is a weird kind of FOMO.

Transparent background for weather cal widget?
I’ve just discovered scriptable and weather cal, and I’m wondering if there’s an option for transparent background with weather cal? I’ve seen many that appear that way, but I’m not sure if it’s a well crafted image or not. 
Any help would be appreciated!

[Update] Upcoming Calendar Events Widget
It's been a long time since I have updated this one because most focus has been on Upcoming Calendar Indicator, but due to the request to add reminder support, I have now updated this widget to follow the similar technique. 

You can now choose to have reminders display in your events list and it will show whether it has been completed or not. 

[Here](https://i.imgur.com/jIB32gB.jpg) is an example. 

To get the latest code for this widget, please see my [GitHub page](https://github.com/mvan231/Scriptable/blob/main/README.md#upcoming-calendar-events-widget).

Use files to save a link then open it when you tap the widget?
I made this script that displays a random Reddit text post from a subreddit on a widget that I will share via shortcut because it is easier to copy. I was wondering if it is possible to save the link that I collected with the script and put it in a file when it runs. Then when you click the widget it will open the latest link to the post.

Weird Unknown Calendar Events When Using Agenda Widget
I’ve been using the Agenda large widget for awhile (has the date, says good morning, battery, weather and events on calendar). 

It’s set to all calendars showing and I’ve turned off all calendars on my phone, and these unknown events are still showing up. 

For example, I’m clicking on “Dinner With Ricardo” which was set to 8:30 pm last night. It’s nowhere in any of my calendars and I don’t even know a Ricardo. Today, a “Wellness Appointment” that lasts for 6 hours. 

Thing is, these are taking up room for my actual events to not show. It’s weird. Strange. 

Anyone else have this issue?

Hello! I really need some help with setting the transparent background for the widget. I have saved the background image in the file bookmark and set the background mode to 1 wallpaper.

Proxyman is pretty close to Derail, a HTTP/HTTPS proxy I was building a year ago. Because of boring reasons I haven’t managed to wrap up my app and publish it, so I’m very happy to see Proxyman launching on iOS! 😃 https://t.co/iXI9on7s4F

Open YouTube and cast to a device and play the playlist
Is there a way to cast to a device? I have Chromecast and would love to quickly just play my YouTube playlist by clicking a button instead of just automating opening the app with playlist. It should go further as to play and also cast.

Safari.openInApp("https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6hvMTQfdoGPjOMCnDPgD0-_mPG36tbsL?autoplay=1")

How do I cast? The ?autoplay=1 doesn’t seem to work either.

However I cannot seem to find a way to print to the phone.   Not console.log which is hidden but when running an app such as Hello World I would like to see it on the screen.  I’ve tried using alerts but I’m sure I’m using it wrong.    Any help would be great.  Thanks.

WeatherCal random calendar events
This may sound bizarre but I have had this happen twice now: where a random calendar event I never created is showing up as an event on the weather cal widget. When I tap on the event and the calendar app opens there is no such event in my calendar app. I also checked my wife’s calendar app which is linked to mine and there’s no such event in hers either. Strangely, the first time this happened the event was listed as a job interview and I coincidentally had a job interview but I had never placed it in my personal calendar. Today’s random event is lunch with my wife. Any insight as to how this could be happening?

Did you know the @_disfavoredOverload attribute? It helps removing the disambiguity between 2 identical overloads. Of course, the _ indicates it’s a private attribute so consider it twice before using it in production 😉

Working on Markdown support for my text editor. This is a good opportunity to ensure that it handles mixed font sizes well. That has proven to be tricky but I think I’ve almost got it now.

My bet: If you’ve been to any of the events Apple have invites developers to the past month, you know what this is about.

Apple used a new way to watch videos, write questions to the engineers and book 1:1 sessions. I’m almost sure they’ll use this for WWDC. https://t.co/sZEUb9PWZR

WWDC21 is coming! Now is a good time to ensure that you’re app is ready for you to adopt new tech.

📦 Ensure core logic is in frameworks so it can be reused in extensions.
🗑 Get rid of dependencies that aren’t updated frequently.

That way you’ll have a much more fun week 😃

It would be fun if Apple made a feature in the WWDC app to generate those “Memoji looks at a MacBook like Craig Federighi” images with our own Memoji. I *think* that could be done with SceneKit, which Memoji already uses. That way we could all be in a Hairforce One meme. https://t.co/dv0u8gwjkB

Creating a single-byte string from 0xFF
How do I create a single-byte string containing the hex value of 0xff? The base64 encoding of such a string is supposed to be `/w==` but

	return btoa(String.fromCharCode('0xff'))

gives me `w78=` and

	return Data.fromString(String.fromCharCode('0xff')).getBytes()

gives me `[195,191]` not 255.

I guess Scriptable converts Unicode hex U+00FF into UTF-8 0xC3BF. Is there a way to turn off the UTF-8 conversion?

Hey guys. 

Completely noob here. Just trying to figure out how I can simply fetch the content from an html file via url. The content is in the body tag of the html file.

The html structure is very basic and looks like this:

<html>

<head>

</head>

<body>0.00024737</body>

</html>

&#x200B;

Would really appreciate some help:)

Thanks in advance and have a nice day.

Instagram has a feedback menu. You trigger it by shaking your device or long pressing the home icon. I’d like to think they shipped it intentionally but I’ve accidentally triggered it so often by just using the app that I’m starting to think they shipped it by accident.

Sometimes I think people won’t like my text editor because it isn’t *completely* perfect.

Then I look at Xcode and see things like this. Line highlighting is messed up. Not even Xcode get the basics right all the time. 

But then I remember that people don’t like Xcode either 😬

Polished the UI of my text editor a bit.

The header now collapses to make room for a bit more text on the screen.

More symbols are easily accessible by swiping on buttons (similar to Apple’s keyboard)

The line/column numbers float above the text. https://t.co/xGaMOTyEMI

Calendar Events Mass Move
Hey everyone,

I’m looking for a solution to a strange problem. I want to be able to move my entire days worth of calendars back by 45 minutes if I run into an issue in my morning routine. My entire calendar is set up on Google calendar, and usually starts at 9:30 AM, but I want to be able to move that back by 45 minutes and have each subsequent event move with it if I need to have a little extra time in the morning. 

I’m not sure if this is in need of a scriptable or shortcuts solution - any one have any ideas on how to automate this?

Make scriptable as a player for live streams like m3u8?
There is a YouTube pip shortcuts 

https://routinehub.co/shortcut/6622/

It uses scriptable as a player for YouTube links. It's very convenient,because it stands alone,no need to open safari. 

It's a pity that it only support YouTube, someone good at coding can modify it to support m3u8 or other types of live streams? supporting YouTube is not a must.

Appreciate your help.

Help me make a small widget to display VPN used data
I have a VPN API about consumed data. the api result is:

{"monthly_bw_limit_b":100000000000,"bw_counter_b":15449007666,"bw_reset_day_of_month":29}

monthly_bw_limit_b is total data=100G

bw_counter_b means used data

I want the widget only display the used data , the standard of measurement would be Gb if possible. 

Thanks for your help.

On this, app/game devs might wonder what they can do to boost chances of coverage. Here are tips that work for me. THREAD!

1. Tell me about your app. Seems obvious, right? But many app/game devs never contact the press. That makes it harder for us to find your amazing work! >>> https://t.co/YdmuNlRMB5

Struggling to understand if UITextInteraction is supposed to scroll a UIScrollView when the cursor is moved to the edges of a UIScrollView. It does in some cases but not all and it doesn’t do it like a classic UITextView. Unsure what I need to handle and what it handles for me 🤔

If you have issues proxying HTTPS traffic through @charlesproxy from iOS simulators in Xcode 12.5, it may be because “Install Charles Root Certificate in iOS Simulators” doesn’t work with Xcode 12.5. You’ll need to export the certificate, drag it into the simulator and trust it.

Shortcut for hiding apps through Screen Time?
Recently switched over from Android and was a little upset to find there was no app hiding or second user system on iPhone. 

I did find that you could go into settings set up a password and block apps by age with Screen Time to hide them. Is there a shortcut to enable blocking apps with it on Scriptable or something? 

I just don't wanna have to go into settings every time I wanna hide my apps. Something like a Siri command would be way simpler, but I'm not sure how to set something like that up.

Tried making my own in the shortcuts app but there wasn't an option to toggle that setting through automation

Youtube videos on a widget via @scriptableapp
It displays the most recent videos from a list of configured channelIds.
- Get a key on google console
- Add the channel id that you want
Careful with your paid accounts, this widget uses a lot of your quota 💸

Regex Help With Getting Inside Of HTML Links
I am making a word of the day widget that doesn’t use an API. It gets everything from a website. I need to be able to filter out the <a href..> and </a> so it keeps the inside of the links. I don’t know regex but I would appreciate the help.

This is an example of the text:

<a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/magnetite">magnetite</a> possessing <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/polarity">polarity</a>

In this case it would get “magnetite possessing polarity”

Getting data out of an google sheet problem
Hi all,

I am currently looking into making a widget wich gets its data from an google sheet. I‘ve found this [article](https://medium.com/@mutsuda/create-an-ios-widget-showing-google-spreadsheets-data-856767a9447e ) and am able to get data out of it so far. 

The strange thing i don‘t really get is that the data i want to use isn‘t showing up in the widget. 

I tried it with changing the pages to see if the data is showing up in the widget but that is not gonna happen from the page i want to use. The other ones are showing data when i change to them.


Maybe someone has some idea what i can check

Autocorrection doesn’t work with UITextInteraction. Selecting a suggestion will cause it to call a non-existing -replace(_:) function and pass an instance of the private UITextReplacement type. These eight lines make autocorrect work but will probably get the app rejected 🤷‍♂️

3 Temperatures Widget - OpenHAB
Hi! I’m making a series of widgets using Scriptable, from iOS. Today I have finished my first widget, to show 3 different temperatures.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/971o60w5dcu61.png?width=338&format=png&auto=webp&s=5b6c7b9a6e45234ec3f785e42fdd6e9e2bb9ce56

The widget only needs to be configured with the username and password,  to obtain the data. Obviously it can be edited to anyone’s whim, I hope  this helps.  
I configured the widget in such a way that I could get the data, via [myopenhab.org](http://myopenhab.org/) to be able to use it anywhere.

[Link to code](https://github.com/sebasanblas/Scriptable-OpenHAB/tree/main/3temperatures-widgets)

In the next few days I will be uploading more widgets.

I hope someone finds it useful!

Greetings.

Coming via Twitter, I saw a lot of cool widgets in this subreddit.

Do you think Scriptable the best app for creating widget or is it just one of many for you?

If you prefer a different app, which one is it?

Regex Regular Expression That Would Remove All Text In HTML Strong Tags And The Strong Tags
My word of the day widget script is not working on all of the days. Because there are so many different ways the definitions are formatted I cannot replace them all. I would like a regex expression that could remove the tags and inside of strong tags from a string. 

Example 

`<strong>1 :</strong> a fundamental or quintessential part or feature ➤ basis`

This would turn out 

 a fundamental or quintessential part or feature ➤ basis

Thanks for the help.

Is this something I should worry about? The process has crashed 58 times during the last 48 hours. Can I somehow increase the jetsam memory limit / make the widget use less memory? This is happening with the weather-cal widget.

I really wanted to use SwiftUI for this screen but as far as I can tell there’s no way to enable selection of rows while in edit mode and I need that. UIKit has allowsSelectionDuringEditing but it seems there’s nothing similar in SwiftUI.

The US, German, Italian and British Apple Stores list at what time of day people can start ordering AirTags. The Danish store doesn’t. I assume it’s at the same time as other stores but still weird.

I’m not an expert in programming languages but there must be some common mechanism that can be implemented in Swift to make it less painful to implement the delegate pattern in generic types. Maybe generic interfaces from C# and Java?

Progress widget alignment
Hi,

i am using the progress script from juniorchen a little bit and i was wondering if it is possible to have some more progress bars in an big widget like i made it with photoshop in this picture

[https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44068529/115153510-a1702b00-a076-11eb-9153-65c1da1a1b0a.jpeg](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44068529/115153510-a1702b00-a076-11eb-9153-65c1da1a1b0a.jpeg)

&#x200B;

Currently all the bars will be line up right underneath the other and when there are to many then the last ones won't be shown anymore on the widget. so does anyone know a way to place some on the right and the others on the left??

Widget does not display anything
I have written a script that gets some html from a web site (using Request object), parse it using regular expression, then build a widget with some text boxes and the data from that web site. 

When running it from within Scriptable it works fine. But when adding it as a widget it does not display anything. 

And ideas?

Problem with widget when taking more than few seconds to load.
I have a script that gets some data from a web site, parse the html, and create a widget with the data.
If I supply demo data, everything works fine. but when trying to get the data from the site, it can take a few seconds for the html to return - this is because this site is slow, and not a problem in my script - in that situation, the widget is not displayed.

Is there any way to make the widget refresh itself after the data is loaded?

Is the Apple TV 4K noticeably faster than the Apple TV HD? I’m using an Apple TV HD and the old DTK. I have a 4K TV but don’t really care about that. The main reason for me to upgrade to the new Apple TV is if it’s noticeably faster.

API changed, now getting error message.
Hello!

I have been using a [script](https://gist.github.com/sharn25/e67a312a43ecee6cdde3995f8ab211f9) for an Anime Quotes widget from Sharn25. 

Since the developer (for the API) rebuilt the site (hence, the change in url), I also tried switching to the [new url](https://animechan.vercel.app/) within the script, however, I'm getting an error, "Undefined is not an object".

I've made a few more attempts but still got the same error. 

I'm fairly new to Javascript, so I couldn’t figure out where the problem is?

One of the best decisions I made for Scriptable was to put documentation online. It makes it so much easier to answer most support mails when I can add a link an API that can help users get further with their solution.

Light Strip Notifications?
Hi everyone, I'm new to Scriptable and JavaScript in general but I thought I would see if I could mess around with it to achieve more than what the Shortcuts app had to offer. My main goal at the moment is to see if I can have my LED light strip flash when I get a text notification, but the Shortcuts app by itself doesn't support anything like that right now. The light strip itself is connected to my Apple Home network. I've downloaded "Signals" from the App Store which flashes my light strip exactly how I would like for it to, but I haven't been successful in integrating it with the other available shortcut tools. I tend to get too focused on what I'm working on and miss text notifications for hours at a time, so I figured I would be less likely to miss a notification if my lights flashed with it instead of only getting vibrational notifications from my watch. I've been kind of surprised that I haven't seen anything related to this idea yet since I feel like a lot of people could use it! I'm completely open to any ideas or suggestions and I'm excited to dive into Scriptable!

Is it possible to make a property wrapper that:

1. Stores a value in UserDefaults.
2. Can be combined with the @Publisher property wrapper.

I’d like to create a SettingsStore where each property is stored in UserDefaults but also let me to observe changes to the properties.

What are your most used scripts and widgets?
Hello r/Scriptable,

discovered the app recently and I'm curious what some of your most used scripts and widgets are.

I know that a lot of widgets has been shared, but I assume some of them might just be some kind of "one and done" widget( similar to some people on r/Widgy designing a lot of widgets just because they have fun doing it)

&#x200B;

Seen a lot of homescreen screenshot with a Covid Scriptable widget, but I pretty sure that not the only interesting type of widget Scriptable has.

I curious which widgets or scripts you actually use :)

Can somebody explain the XMLParser behavior to a Newbie?
JS/Scriptable beginner here:

I'm trying to work with XMLParser to parse a xml I retrieve from the web.

I basically works, but I don't understand the XMLParser.foundCharacter results.

A part of input xml(used in the example) might look like this:

`<desc lang="de">`

`Träume und Tragödien, Träume und Tragödien`

`</desc>`

XMLParser returns 2 results:

`Tr` and `äume und Tragödien, Träume und Tragödien`

Expected result: 

single output `Träume und Tragödien, Träume und Tragödien`

Script link:[https://pastebin.com/xz8vi7C0](https://pastebin.com/xz8vi7C0)

&#x200B;

It seems that the split happens when it reaches the first german specific letter (ä,ö,ü,ß),but can somebody tell why this happens?

Also is there a way to fix this instead of constructing a string from the segments?

Thanks for any help or useful infos.

At first I thought it was a given that the new AirPods would come in colors. Then I remembered that the products Apple have recently added colors to (AirPods Max, iPad Air, iMacs) are all made of aluminum. Colored plastic AirPods will probably look too cheap for Apple’s liking.

I made an automated Shortcut and @scriptableapp widget to alert me when a new version of the App Store Connect API is available or if the OpenAPI Spec file changes 😁

Need to be able to make those @FastlaneTools changes right away 💪

Hey! Can someone help me to get the infos on [this](https://www.countee.ch/app/de/counter/impfee/_iz_sachsen) site into a widget? I only need the big numbers (right now all 0) into a list that can be displayed. I have absolutely no experience with js. I only know a little html css and have made some Siri Shortcuts in the past but I don’t seem to get this site to give me its information in shortcuts.

Main take aways so far:

1. *Way* more people use multiple cursors that I thought. I’ve never used it.
2. People want search and replace. Ideally with regex. 

Luckily search and replace is the last big feature on my todo list before I have feature freeze on version 1.0. https://t.co/lMOqB64b0I

Usually I open up TestFlight to everyone who’d like to join and I’ll also do that for Runestone, but I decided to get people onboard in batches. That way fewer people are exposed to the usual teething troubles and I feel more confident that I’m able to catch-up with the feedback.

It has been a slow week in this subreddit and I haven't seen a showcase post for a long time.

Do you have any widgets that aren't available publicly(yet),but you already like?

You can describe and/or post a screenshot. Maybe it can be inspirational to some other creators. :)

Great blog post! I’ll add that you don’t have to choose between auto layout and manual layout using frames. It’s perfectly fine to use both in a project. I’ll use auto layout by default but sometimes it’s easier to use frames and/or the code becomes more readable by doing so. https://t.co/eb3ubvKpU1

Sorry, I’m very new to all this stuff and don’t really know what I’m doing. I have a widget for scriptable I downloaded from github and I have made widgets for UK, Singapore, and World, but I’m trying to make one for NZ too except none of the ways I enter ‘new Zealand’ seem to work in the link - new_zealand, new-zealand, new.zealand, NZ. The widget is specifically using the coronavirus-19-api.herokuapp.com source. Can anyone help me work out what to put in for ‘New Zealand’?

I’ve got a great setup with widgets apart from the reminders one with its ugly light grey background. I really wouldn’t know where to begin making my own widget, does anyone know if someone’s already made something like this?

So I then try to load google and click the first element from search but it also doesn't work. It loads google with the search but Doesn't seem to click the element.

I don’t know shit about scriptable so here’s a request:

A script that routinely gets the most recent video in your camera roll and compresses it until it is *at most* 8 mb. Then it replaces the video in your camera roll with the compressed one.

Hi Scriptable community!

I am working on a widget that source data from an unstable website. When the website is down, from my browser, after a ~1 min of loading I can see a webpage “error 504, timeout”.

Is there any way to check within scriptable if the page load under 5 seconds / ping the website ?

Oh daannngggg! Looks look Apple dropped new version of the App Store Connect API today 😱 It was previously at 1.2 and now it’s at 1.3 

Time to go look at what changed and see what we can put into @FastlaneTools 😁

So glad my @scriptableapp widget alerted me!

Secretly hoped to have version 1.0 of my text editor done before WWDC. At this point I’ll have to admit to myself that isn’t happening. It needs a bit more polishing and at least one more feature. Good things take time, they say.

Delete events from Calendar B if event no longer exists in Calendar A
Hi everyone,

&#x200B;

I've recently made a shortcut that successfully duplicates any events from my work calendar from a subscribed account to a native iCloud calendar. However, I would also like to create a shortcut that, when run, checks to see if the original event from the work calendar still exists, and if it does not, to delete the copied event in the iCloud calendar.

&#x200B;

The idea was to use Scriptable to create a script that could bypass the need to confirm the removal of a calendar event, however I am unsure as to how to begin tackling the script.

&#x200B;

Ideally the script:

1. Checks between the two calendars for the next 21 days
2. Removes the iCloud calendar event if the work calendar event no longer exists
3. Deletes the iCloud calendar event without the need for confirmation

&#x200B;

Hope this is possible and someone is able to lend a helping hand :)

&#x200B;

Thanks,

Blu

(Unpopular?) opinion: All classes should be marked as `final by default in Swift. Use `open` or another keyword when needing to deviate from the default.

Delete all script and paste from clipboard
Hi, 

First of all I want to let you know that I discovered this app 2 days ago and I am still learning how to use it.

Now, my question is this (or request). Is there possible that a button that deletes all the code and a button that paste from clipboard to be added in the text editor?

The reason for this that if you have the same Apple ID in MacOS and iPhone you can copy/paste very easily. Ex. You copy a text in MacOS and you can paste this text in iPhone immediately (and vice versa). 

Now what I do is:

1.  I write the code in my Mac.
2. Long click on Scriptable Editor.
3. Select all the code.
4. Long click.
5. Paste.

With these 2 buttons it will be:

1. Copy the code from Mac.
2. Click delete button
3. Click Paste from clipboard button

Or maybe a button that does both step 2 and 3.

Does anybody know how to make a scriptable look like this? This is on Widgy but I recently figured the battery level seems more accurate using scriptable

It’s going to be interesting to see if Apple is bridging any of their old APIs to async/await, much like what they did the NSError pointer and `throws` in Swift. In theory they could bridge methods with completion handlers like `(Bool, Error?) -> Void`.

Also really hyped about the introduction of actors in Swift 5.5. Together with async/await this will drastically change how Swift developers need to think about asynchronous code but it’s all for the better. Async code will be much easier to reason about.

Scriptable + VSCode = ❤️
Hello everybody! Now I am working on one simple project that will allows you to create your scriptable apps using VSCode, with autocomplete, hotkey to run scriptable(CMD+SHIFT+B), ability to import scripts to git repository as LINK(it will be synced!! between app and git(on push)). Are you interested in this? Work in progress, and I am just wondering is it will be interesting for any of you? Feel free to ask any questions or make some suggestions

How to get Shortcut's "Choose from menu" in Scriptable?
I have been re-writing my shortcuts with Scriptable but got stuck trying to get the result of a user's choice. My requirement is that I should be able to complete the script from the lock-screen.

1) Does Scriptable already allow some way of doing it (w/o using Shortcuts)?

2) Is it possible to replicate this behavior integrating Scriptable-Shortcuts?

I already tried x-callback-url from Scriptable to Shortcuts: it works, but iOS launches Scriptable then jumps to Shortcuts to prompt the menu; otherwise, if I uncheck "Run In App", it crashes with "Error: XCallbackURL is not supported in Siri."

Made some drastic performance improvements in my text editor today. Opening a document that started with a *very* long line would take several seconds. Now it opens instantly 😌

I would always typeset a line in its entirety. Now I only typeset a line until the screen is filled.

Trouble trying to create this Widget layout/design.
Hello, I've got to the point where I have spent way too long then I'm proud of trying to design this layout for my Widget. What I'm trying to do is create something like this, https://imgur.com/a/O1DZtnV where the blue rectangles represent an image (top being the biggest and the remaining 4 all have equal sizes and contain a top and bottom text field).

After some looking around I found a project posted on GitHub that has a grid of images. After looking and using some aspects of the code I got something that I think is really close to what I want. Here is what it looks like right now, https://imgur.com/a/fnonIxM. 

The issue I have right now is, I can't seem to get the grid of 4 images/text to be in the centre like the main image. I also have trouble increasing the size of the images in the grid. If I change the

    folderElement.imageSize = new Size(110, 50)

it seems to affect the whole widget and miss-aligns the top image along with the top and bottom text that is supposed to follow each of the four images in the grid.

I'm not sure if my approach in designing/creating the grid elements is completely wrong or if this design is too complicated to be done in Scriptable. Any help or insights at all would be great, thank you!

Link to the layout source code of what I have at the moment (code is a little messy): https://pastebin.com/Qzr45rpq

I find it kind of stunning that Shortcuts can’t natively search a folder in iCloud Drive/Shortcuts for a pattern match, or even just list the contents of a folder.

Love me some inline @scriptableapp shortcut actions to solve problems like this. 😍

Scriptable + Excel
Hi all!

I am noob in javascript and other stuff, but trying to make a widget that is showing cell-value, calculated in Excel file stored on OneDrive for Business.

At first, I made a GET URL for getting cell's data in MSGraph sandbox (I have been granted access to 1drive for MSGraph). I have application ID registered in Azure also.

What’s my next move to make Scriptable get data (all these auth things and so on)?

Request() giving me a different response
I have an issue at the moment that doesn't make sense to me. I'm accessing an undocumented / private API endpoint that requires a couple of OAuth Headers. I make sure to provide all the needed headers/tokens along with ensuring that the request method is a GET request.

The weird part is I get back a JSON 400 response indicating a failure occurred. 
This doesn't make sense to me at all because when I copy the EXACT same header data that contains the required tokens and put it inside Postman I get back the data I want. I even tried making the request through Axios and it worked correctly.

The even weirder part is my Scriptable file accesses MANY of the same OAuth API endpoints with the needed header tokens and it works through the app, but for whatever reason, this one doesn't seem to work when it is run on my phone/through Scriptable.

I know it probably seems like I'm messing up somewhere in the request code but I'm 10000000% positive that it is correctly set up. Has anyone else experienced something similar with Request()? My only guess right now is that I need to include some extra headers that Postman / Axios is using because this endpoint doesn't seem to accept mobile devices?

One thing I miss about WWDC, at this point in time, is the “fake” schedule of sessions for the week. It said very little about what we could expect, but it was great for building hype 😄

The selection of digital lounges baffle me a bit. Accessibility, Developer Tools, Machine Learning and SwiftUI. Why is Apple’s darling, Augmented Reality, not in the list? Sure, one can argue that ARKit is a developer tool but so is CoreML and yet Machine Learning is in the list.

First time seeing Twitter’s new Tip Jar in the wild. Hi there @HeySaiK 👋 I hope they’ll support more payment providers over time to make the feature more accessible. Maybe they could even cut a deal with Apple and allow payments with Apple Pay?

Ever worked on a problem and thought to yourself “I wish I could discuss this with the engineer at Apple who worked on it”?

Start thinking back to those times and note them down, because in just a few days, you get a chance to talk to that engineer in the labs at WWDC.

[Update] Upcoming Calendar Indicator
I have been working on a few different updates and requests that users have had for my Upcoming Calendar Indicator widget.

Finally, the day has come where I can release v1.9.

The changes in 1.9 are quite significant in terms of beneath the surface code improvements. Overall the widget loads much faster and some new features were implemented as well for further customization.

&#x200B;

Changes in 1.9 are:

 \- Add color highlight option of Saturday and Sunday\\n- Add option to color the text of the day initials

\- Better alignment of dates with single event dots

\- Removed some extra stacks that werent needed to help with RAM usage

\- Added optimized method for array handling

\- Added prevMonth and nextMonth flags to allow display of dates from the previous and next months if the start and end week have available slots

\- Added setup question for the showDatesBeforeAfter

\- Optimized the URL used for each date in the right side calendar view so they open the proper date in the calendar app

\- Modified size of the date stacks on the right side to better accomodate larger months like May 2021

\- Modified event list view so tapping an event goes to the proper day if the event is allDay

&#x200B;

As always, the code for the widget is located \[here on my GitHub repo\]([https://github.com/mvan231/Scriptable/tree/main/Upcoming%20Calendar%20Indicator](https://github.com/mvan231/Scriptable/tree/main/Upcoming%20Calendar%20Indicator))

&#x200B;

For an example of the latest version and what it could look like, you can see this screenshot, which shows usage of the saturdaySundayHighlight and the dayColor item to change the day initial colors.

“Where were you when Swift was announced?”, asked no one ever.

But I have the answer. It was 7 years ago on this day, and I was in a very dark room with a cup of coffee, a plate of fruit and a vintage Tweetbot app in front of me.

The aggressive schedule was possible because we *already had* good APIs. We used them to ship the 1.0 iPhone! The SDK task became making those internal APIs public. Much of that was name scrubbing and deciding what features we cared to support for the long haul. https://t.co/yX88QVVAg0

So I have weathercal on my Home Screen and it works great except when the temperature goes into the triple digits, it cuts off the last digit only to replace it with “…” 

Is there any way to decrease the space between columns? Any help would be appreciated. Thanks!

Need help deleting water reminder script.
I was trying to add a YouTube PIP script and was having some issues figuring it out. I downloaded the “random” script that it gives you when you click on the “Random Scriptable API” to see where the scripts would go or how to get it to work. Well anyways, now I’m getting water reminder alerts every 10 mins. I can’t figure out how to stop them. I’ve gone through almost everything I could think of but I’m not figuring it out. It’s become an annoying issues and the alerts are getting out of hand. >.< any help to try to stop these would be amazing.

There are often a new type of apps that launch with the new major version of iOS. We’ve seen iMessage apps, shelf apps and recently Shortcuts and widget apps. I think there are two candidates this year.

1. Mac-specific Shortcuts apps
2. Safari extensions on iOS

Do you use diffable data source?

If so, there are some big changes in iOS 15:
- applySnapshot(_: animatingDifferences: false) now diffs & only performs minimal updates to UI
- New API applySnapshotUsingReloadData if you want reloadData
- New API to efficiently reconfigure items!

The new adaptive shortcuts bar in iPadOS 15 feels very similar to what I’ve built for Scriptable. I guess that’s mostly a good thing 😅 #WWDC21 https://t.co/fSfeGhKS9L

My tiny tool for customizing websites using Safari Web Extensions can now differentiate between websites. In this video I use CSS and JS to hide the header on https://t.co/57y3eHZf5x and add a keyboard shortcut. I also use CSS to make https://t.co/q7c2lXB5i8 darker 😃 #WWDC21 https://t.co/TfjEQVSmey

There are many things I want to do with my apps this year, and new apps I wish I had the time to build. I *think* my priorities for the summer are:

1. Get Data Jar running on macOS
2. Wrap up 1.0 of Runestone

Hopefully I’ll find time to work on Scriptable for Mac along the way.

Script that opens a link while also replacing a part of it?
YouTube now requires users to send Google their credit card to watch age restricted videos which is ridiculous and I don't want to do that. An alternative to this is using https://invidio.us/ to watch age restricted videos so I'm wondering if it would be possible to create a script that allows you to select a YouTube link and chose to open it in a browser, while also replacing "youtube.com" with "invidio.us" in the link.

For the most part I like the changes to Safari in iOS 15 but after using it for a week I’m doubtful of two things.

1. The floating/not-floating address bar doesn’t work. It’s unpredictable and covers important elements on the website.
2. Pull to refresh isn’t good for browsers.

Entering text on my Apple Watch using my iPhone seems like an odd feature. It’s cool but I can’t think of when I would use it. Wouldn’t I just use the iPhone variant of the app instead? Assuming one exists but it almost always does.

Actually it’s a bit odd that Safari’s combined address and search bar have been moved to the bottom of the screen in iOS 15 when the search bar is at the top everywhere else in iOS. Makes me wonder if Apple will move it to the bottom in more places.

Dark mode widget
I’m trying to make a widget switch it’s background image based on whether my iPhone is in dark mode or not.

So far I have the current code

//var darkMode = !(Color.dynamic(Color.white(),Color.black()).red)
var darkMode = Device.isUsingDarkAppearance()

if (darkMode == true) {
  widgetHello.backgroundImage = Image.fromFile(backgroundImageDark);
} else {  
  widgetHello.backgroundImage = Image.fromFile(backgroundImageLight);
}

(Posting from phone so formatting may suck)

The image paths work and the methods of detecting dark mode work. Running it inside scriptable works and it follows the if/else rules correctly.

BUT when run as a widget, no matter if the phone is light or dark mode, it will set the background as the dark mode version. This happens irrespective of whether I create the widget in light or dark mode. 

Any ideas?

For example it can run at the start of every minute.

@simonbs Humans are at their best when they struggle and have to find creative solutions to problems.   The additional battery hours is a crutch that makes developers lazy: gone are the days of thinking before turning on the computer and wasting precious battery time

I really dig that all these old games are coming to Apple Arcade. I’m still on a free trial but I have a feeling that, for some reason, I’ll be willing to pay a monthly fee to play old games that I’ve already completed.

Been working a lot on Data Jar lately. The next update is shaping up to be a good one. I’ll have to admit, though, that I’m looking forward to work on Runestone again, so I can start integrating it into Scriptable and Jayson.

Spotify getting into podcasts,  live-streaming concerts and launching Greenroom all seem to fit pretty well together. Greenroom will be the place to get closer to your favorite musicians and podcast hosts. And why not use the live-stream platform to host live podcasts too?

Xcode Cloud will set CI_BUILD_NUMBER as the build number of your app but it appears there’s no way to set the initial (or next) value of CI_BUILD_NUMBER. That’s going to cause frustration for developers whose build numbers now start at 1 again.

The next version of Data Jar will drop support for iOS 13. There are several reasons for this. The main one being that only 0.4% of sessions the past month are from iOS 13. The number comes from App Store Connect.

Recruiters being like “Hey! I’m looking for people with your experience. Got time for a call?” seems rude to me.

I get that you need to recruit people but tell me who your client is and what they’re looking for. Then I can judge if we’d be wasting each others time on a call.

I feel like there’s room in the market for a privacy-first Swiss Army knife-like service for mobile developers. It should offer:

1. Simple analytics
2. Localisation
3. Feature flags

Make it flexible enough for organisations but offer a price point where indies can afford it.

That’s not the case. Your data is stored safely in iCloud.

I’ve realised that the Spotify app is my favorite app. I’ve often overlooked it when asked about my favorite app because it “just” runs in the background. But it does that almost all day long for me.

It looks good, helps me discover new music and “just works”. Great app. 5/5 ⭐️

How to make an alert with pressable buttons and a text field?
I have a script to create an alert, then I test if the secure text field “pass” is 1234. But I made a print statement, and pass is always null. I also want to wait till a enter button is pressed to check the password. Please help!

Code:
```

const prompt = new Alert()

prompt.message = "Enter Password"
const pass = prompt.addSecureTextField("Password", "Password")
const cancel = prompt.addDestructiveAction("Cancel")
const enter = prompt.addAction("Enter")

if (enter) {
	console.log("Test")
}

prompt.presentAlert()
console.log(prompt.present())

let val = prompt.textFieldValue(1)
console.log(val)


if (prompt.textFieldValue(1) == "1234") {
	
	const correct = new Alert()
	
	correct.message = "Correct!"
	
	correct.addAction("Continue")
	
	correct.presentAlert()
}
```

Safari’s address bar is shown above the keyboard in iOS 15 beta 3. That’s a great change! 

I wish that the cancel button would be closer to the keyboard (and consequently the address bar), similar to where the Done button is placed when entering text in a text field.

Played around with using UIMenus instead of a fullscreen modal with the same options. Looks modern but feels a bit more cumbersome to use than the fullscreen version.

There’s something about the Spotify Stations app that reminds me about apps from 5-ish years ago, and that’s meant as a big compliment. It’s barebones but manages to solve a single task very well. It’s colorful and playful. I love it 🥰 https://t.co/HRt1ZkcRpv

I would instabuy an iPhone with always-on display but that’s because I’m a nerd. I don’t see the broad appeal. Most people I know either:

1. Have their iPhone in their pocket.
2. Lay their iPhone face down to avoid distractions.
3. Look at their iPhone all the time anyways 🤷‍♂️ https://t.co/YSHeLLQ8xE

Data Jar is coming to the Mac later this year 💻

If you’re running the macOS 12 beta, then I would love if you’ll help me test Data Jar for Mac 😃

Spotify heard that floating panels at the bottom of the screen is all the rage these days. 

I like it. Seems like a good way to freshen up the app without reinventing everything. https://t.co/v8BEUU5TBi

Something I should have foreseen while developing Scriptable is that people will use App Store ratings to complain about scripts developed by others.

Scriptable’s rating is slowly going down because of these 😞

The bug in the latest iOS 15 and macOS 12 builds causing CloudKit operation to fail for beta apps is severe. Presumably all beta apps using CloudKit are affected. Bugs are expected in betas. I’m just saying that if haven’t updated to the beta already, now is not the time.

The new Zens charger would look great on my desk, and I am in fact in the market for an “all in one” charger, but I’m a bit put off by the lack of “true” MagSafe. Just because my iPhone supports it and it would always be in the back of my mind that I’m not taking advantage of it. https://t.co/cxYTVsfDFT

When I asked people to recommend a webcam, many suggested to use an old iPhone and the Camo app. I had an iPhone 6 Plus laying around, so I decided to give it a shot. Received my mount today and I’m now testing this setup.

Sorry for the mess. Still setting up my home office 📦✨

Do you have any sources for scripts/widgets beside this subreddit/automators? Are you still creating widgets in Scriptable?
Long time lurker here,

since the output in this subreddit died down a lot compared to a few month ago & the subreddit for another popular widget app, I'm wondering if you any other sources where I can find cool widgets aside from r/Scriptable and the automators forum. I'm bad at coding and bad at having cool ideas.

Also out of interest: 

Do you still code in Scriptable or are you done with it until a new version with new features arrives, because you made or downloaded everything you need?

I spent quite some time on a custom UICollectionViewLayout that:

1. Layout items in a list.
2. Supports self-sizing cells with per-cell estimated height.
3. Has proper animations when inserting and deleting items.
4. Has good scroll performance.

So happy it finally works 🥲 https://t.co/XCSN21lhWc

LOL. Scraping Twitter for images of desks to rate people’s setups in a blog post is a thing? Didn’t agree to participate in this.

Probably wouldn’t have said no if I was asked but feels weird not to get asked first. https://t.co/5lJ2nIy6Vz

How do I add vertical spacing to this widget?
I am new to scriptable, and am running [this](https://github.com/supermamon/scriptable-week-forecast/blob/master/week-forecast.js) widget. I am trying to figure out how to add vertical spacing, and while I’m sure it’s quite simple, I can’t quite figure it out. 

The relevant code can be found on lines 70-128. Thank you for your help!

I try to keep a positive tone on Twitter but Apple featuring scam apps is starting to piss me off.

Many indie developers spend years upon years polishing their apps hoping to get featured by Apple and seen by users.

Should we just charge $10+ a week for trivial things instead? https://t.co/VOOkgslv6G

How to parse a XML-File/RSS Feed?
Hi everyone :)

Can anybody help me to parse a XML file?

For **example** I have [here](https://status.slack.com/feed/rss) a XML-Feed from Slack Status. 

So how can I get only the second value of the string named "title"?

[XML File - RSS-Feed - Slack Status](https://preview.redd.it/r1pbpqx7mkf71.png?width=1888&format=png&auto=webp&s=ee44959ffbac44e7447b6fbf6478414e123f0a9c)

My current script:

    const req = new Request('https://status.slack.com/feed/rss');
    const data = await req.loadString();
    
    let xmlParser = new XMLParser(data);
    
    xmlParser.didEndElement = (str) => {
        if (str == 'title') //[1] doesn't work
        console.log(value) 
        return str
    }
    
     xmlParser.foundCharacters = (str) => {
        value = str
        return str
    }
    
    xmlParser.parse();
    
    /*Result => 
    Slack System Status
    Incident: A small portion of users may be encountering slowness and sporadic errors
    Incident: Trouble typing in Slack in non-Latin characters

When I bake bread I’ll need about 10 timers that’ll run for the next 12 - 24 hours. I’d like to start them all with a single tap.

The Alert API was the first API I added to Scriptable, so it feels a little special to update it more than three years later. The next update will allow for customisation of text fields in alerts.

How many scripts & widget do you have in your Scriptable library?
Just for fun since I've read some insanely high numbers for Shortcuts(700+ shortcuts) and Scriptable is also often mentioned in r/Shortcuts.

I'm not good at coding, so I only have 17 downloaded widgets.

How many scripts & widgets do you keep in Scriptable & do you use them on a regular basis?

Meteogram widgets?
Hi, I’m a newcomer to Scriptable.

Has anyone made a weather forecast widget containing meteogram? That is, data-packed daily/hourly weather charts with multiple data items visible?

So many iOS weather widgets are poor - either lacking sufficient graphical data or falling on gimmicky/cuddly aesthetic concepts.

Nothing for me has matched Aix weather widget on Android https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=aix+weather+widget&client=safari&hl=en-gb&prmd=inmv&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwihx57f0p7yAhXVuHEKHf-VCmwQ_AUoAXoECAIQAQ&biw=414&bih=715&dpr=2#imgrc=B_gvGy00X99bCM

I know there’s a Meteogram iOS app, but I don’t really like any of the iOS weather widgets. 

The Meteogram app even has an API which allows you to create a meteogram much like Aix’s (perhaps it even enabled it for Aix) https://api.meteograms.com/ The output can be used in a web-to-widget widget. But that method is a little sub-par.

Any ideas please?

It appears that the behaviour of WKWebView.evaluateJavaScript(_:) has changed from iOS 14 to iOS 15. Functions and variables added with -evaluateJavaScript(_:) would be available to subsequent calls to -evaluateJavaScript(_:) on iOS 14 but that’s no longer the case on iOS 15.

I use siri to set reminders on my phone. This work reasonably well. I tried doing this on a car with carplay and I couldn't figure out how to get it to either show me what the reminder said or to speak out the reminder to me when it created it. I'd need it to either speak it or show it so I can see if it captured the text and date right. Is there a way to do this on a car that uses apple carplay?

Never in Scriptable’s lifetime have I looked up the amount of active devices or the number of sessions. Some will say that’s stupid and they’re probably right.

Today I saw the numbers by accident. I’m blown away. They’re way higher than I thought. Turns out people use the app 😅

Help with Share Sheet
Howdy! I'm working on a share sheet script to accept all types and to upload them to a url. The url accepts a PUT request and returns a url that the item can be retrieved from.

This is what I have right now

    let fm = FileManager.local()
    let URL = "https://foo:bar@example.com/upload"
    let uploadedUrls = ""
    
    for (let f of args.plainTexts) {
        await putContents(f)
    }
    for (let f of args.urls) {
        await putContents(getContents(f))
    }
    for (let f of args.images) {
        await putContents(Data.fromPNG(f).getBytes())
    }
    for (let f of args.fileURLs) {
        await putContents(fm.readString(f))
    }
    
    Pasteboard.copyString(uploadedUrls)
    Script.complete()
    
    async function putContents(body) {
        let req = new Request(URL)
        req.method = "PUT"
        req.body = body
        uploadedUrls += await req.loadString() + " "
    }
    
    async function getContents(url) {
        let req = new Request(URL)
        req.method = "GET"
        return await req.load()
    }
    
    async function notify(title, message) {
        let notify = new Notification()
        notify.title = title
        notify.body = message
        await notify.schedule()
    }

I'm struggling with getting the data from the shared items.

When I pass in a image from the photos app, I receive a `UIImage` object, but I can't seem to get the actual data of the image. All I've been sending the web server is an empty request.

Any help would be greatly appreciated. Or even links to examples that are doing similar things.

Thank you very much!

Scriptable has a good number of downloads, active users and sessions per day. I wish I knew what “the next step” is. I think about that a lot these days.

I really love the app and have many ideas for it but I’m not sure which one is the right next step🙇‍♂️

Is it possible to make a battery level widget using scriptable?
I tried to place a battery level indicator on a widget I was building using the  Device.batteryLevel() function but noticed that it did not reflect the true battery level as it was not updating like the native iOS battery widget did. I know we can use the refreshAfterDate to manually refresh the widget to an extent but my concern with that is, i...

Help with making a web request
Hi everyone,

I'm having issues in recreating a web request in Scriptable, below i copied the code that I use in a node.js environment with axios and everything works just fine (where you see '' it's because i deleted the information for privacy).

Can anyone help me recreate this in Scriptable?

    const options = {
        method: 'POST',
        url: 'https://api.fitbit.com/oauth2/token',
        params: {
            refresh_token: '',
            grant_type: 'refresh_token',
            redirect_uri: 'http://localhost'
        },
        headers: {
            cookie: '',
            Authorization: '',
            'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'
        }
        };
    
        axios.request(options).then(function (res) {
            const access_token = res.data.access_token
            const refresh_token = res.data.refresh_token
            ctx.reply(`Access token:\t${access_token}\n\nRefresh       token:\t${refresh_token}`)
            console.log(res.data);
        }).catch(function (err) {
            console.error(err);
        });

It’s showing the relative time of “51 years ago”

I also tried to use “datetime” and it displays 1969-12-31 8:00 PM”. 

I downloaded the RSS file and checked it in text editor and it looks like there are formed dates and times there. Any idea why this is happening?

Hello Guys,  thanx to you I have managed to write Data Info to a text file, and get it back to represent it in Scriptable Widget.  Following the result of the info… I change the background.

Text widget that shows everyday at a specific time another text
I'm not a star at making a scriptable but I think this app can help me with what I've wanted for a very long time. I want a "meal plan" widget that shows a different text every day between a time.

For example, on Monday between 06:00 and 10:00 a text and then another text between 10:00 and 11:30. etc. And on Tuesday between 06:00 and 10:00 another text that differs from Monday.

Could anyone share a script that does this for me? I will be eternally grateful to you!

Leaderboard Table Formatted for iOS Widget
Hello All,

Really appreciated all the amazing work.  I don't have JavaScript skills, but have what I think is probably an easy request.

I'm looking to have the table at this URL converted to a widget: [https://tgccloud.com/2019/reports/lblive19.php](https://tgccloud.com/2019/reports/lblive19.php)

The table will sometimes have RD1, RD2, and RD3.  Sometimes just RD1 and RD2.  The HC column is not necessary if there is a width problem.   Table Title at top would be nice, but is not required if vertical space problem.

I tried to use Glimpse to create the widget, but the table is just too small to see.

I'm thinking 5 lines for the medium size widget and 10 lines for the large.  


If anyone is able to help, that would be much appreciated.

I submitted Data Jar to Apple just five minutes ago and it’s now in review. Scriptable was submitted 24 hours ago and it’s still waiting for review. I’ll never understand how app review works.

But most importantly this update lays the foundation for the upcoming macOS version 🖥

Error: bad URL _only_ on iPad widget
So… I have a widget to collect my Plausible data (Google Analytics alternative) from a couple of sites I’ve built and display the “today” and “live” stats for the site.

I’ve created based on a script that someone else put together with a bit of customisation of my own. The stats are public, so it’s super easy for Scriptable to get via the available endpoint and requires no authentication. 

Currently everything is working perfectly on my iPhone running on iOS 15. However, for some reason, on iPadOS 15, I just get an Error: Bad URL response. Has anyone else run into anything like this?

There’s a fair bit of code, so not sure on the best way to share if anyone wants to look through it, but the fact it works on iOS makes me think it’s likely not the code itself?

The latest update to Scriptable contains a bug that can occur on jailbroken devices with specific tweaks enabled. It’s trivial for me to work around but the code won’t be pretty.

I feel like I need to add a workaround to avoid a potential backlash but I’m not too fond of it 😕

SF Symbols are no longer multicolored by default on iOS 15. Explicitly specifying that the UIImage containing the SF Symbol should be multicolored isn’t enough if the UIImage is later passed to a SwiftUI Image. I had to jump through some hoops to get this working in Scriptable.

Is it possible to rename or hide a widgets name with Scriptable?
I’m new to this so forgive me if I’m not making sense.  I’m trying to hide the name of widgets in iOS 15, is there a script I could run to do this? If not, is there a way to create my own widgets and leave the name blank to keep the name hidden?

Submitted a new build of Data Jar to TestFlight review. This build will hopefully improve the speed and reliability of the Shortcuts actions. It brings significant changes to the implementation of the Shortcuts actions. I’ll need help testing this properly once it’s approved 🙏

Hi,

I'm looking for a way to close instagram whenever the explore page is opened (to solve those nasty procrastination problems) and was wondering if this is possible using scriptable. 

To do this, I need to know if instagram is running and if so what the colours of certain pixels are (the  🔍 symbol changes colour when the explore page is opened). 

I really have no idea of the limitations of scriptable, so is this possible and if not is there an alternative app I could write this in?

I’ve edited some code from some of the forums to create a reminders widget. It all works fine but every now and again I get the following text in the widget which lasts for a few minutes (presumably it fails to refresh sometimes) - *Call Script.setWidget() to set the content of the widget*. I am a javascript newbie and am not sure what is wrong in the code. I was wondering if someone could assist with what is causing it and how I can fix? Code via pastebin link below.

I presume the issue is with the async function at the end which I think is now redundant. If I delete all lines from the async function it still doesn't work so not sure what I need to fix up or add.

Widget Stack memory limit
Hi,

I'm trying to understand Scriptable's memory limitation on the number of stacks.
I did a simple test with this piece of code:

const max = 175;
const widget = new ListWidget();
widget.setPadding(0, 0, 0, 0)
widget.addText(max.toString());
let main = widget.addStack();
main.layoutHorizontally();

for(let i = 1; i < max; i++) {
  let s = main.addStack();
  s.addText(i.toString());
  s.borderWidth = 1;
  s.borderColor = Color.red();
  main.addSpacer(1);
}

Script.setWidget(widget);

When I exceed 165 stack the widget no longer updates.

I also use Widgy to make other widgets and we don't seem to face that kind of limitation.

Is the limit in memory or in number of layers?

Thanks.

I’ve done some digging but can’t find any documentation on iOS issues or anything. I’ve also tried to use a new api key to no avail.

Creating a Scriptable script that changes lockscreen wallpaper based on weather
I have an idea of changing lockscreen wallpaper (and adds some useful text) based on weather from current user location. An automated shortcut (which will be called every n minutes/hour(s)) will be used that will call the Scriptable script. This script will check the current weather (maybe using some APIs) and return the new weather-matching wallpaper (I would set default images for rainy/sunny/… days in-code with data:image/jpeg) with eventually some overlayed useful/fancy texts on it.

The returned image will be used as lockscreen wallpaper from my custom automated shortcut. 

Is this a good idea and possible for iOS? Also, did someone already anticipate me? I don’t want to waste time doing something that someone else already did.

I am running iOS 15+, tell me if you know some similar projects I should look at before starting from zero.

Another business model I’m considering for Runestone is a simple nag screen. It has worked for other developer tools on the Mac so I guess it’ll work on iOS too. I think it’s a decent way to implement a “pay if you like the app or continue using it for free”-mechanism.

I honestly have difficulties understanding why Apple have rejected Data Jar for Mac. Could it be because the app description says “[…] designed to be used with Shortcuts”?. The description for the iOS app have said that since day 1 though.

I resubmitted Data Jar and got rejected again. The reviewer can’t test my app because it isn’t showing up in the Shortcuts app 🤔

I’m happy that this time they provided a detailed explanation of the problem and solution. This time they’ll also accept a video of the app in use.

Listing files with recursive folder
Hi Reddit,
I’ve been trying to make a script about downloading every files in a folder from iCloud.
I can’t get inner folders files to show up.

To sum up,
It  ask to pick a folder, list files in it,
The function should call itself when it encounters a folder and list all its files in the main array 
I can’t wrap my head around it today, I suck.

Help me please ?

----------------------

var fm = FileManager.iCloud()
var dir = fm.documentsDirectory()
var folder = await DocumentPicker.openFolder()

const getAllFiles = function (fm, dirPath, arrayOfFiles) {
  var files = fm.listContents(dirPath)
  var arrayOfFiles = arrayOfFiles || []

  files.forEach(function (file) {

    var fullpath  = fm.joinPath(folder, file)
    if (fm.isDirectory(fullpath)) {

	/* PROBLEM HERE */

     		 arrayOfFiles = getAllFiles(fm, fullpath, arrayOfFiles)
      	// arrayOfFiles.push(getAllFiles(fm, fullpath))
      	// getAllFiles(fm, fullpath)

	/* END PROBLEM*/

    }
    else {
      arrayOfFiles.push(fullpath)
    }
  })
  return arrayOfFiles
}


console.log(getAllFiles(fm, folder))

/* 

loop through big array then => fm.downloadFileFromiCloud(path)

*/

https://reddit.com/r/Scriptable/comments/qfj46p/download_all_files_and_folders_recursively_from/
Download All Files and Folders recursively from iCloud
Hi Reddit,
I wanted to download a folder and all its inner files from iCloud for offline/travel or w/e, found nada,
here is what I’ve been playing with so far.

——————————————————————

const fm = FileManager.iCloud()
const folder = await DocumentPicker.openFolder()

const allFiles = function (fm, dirPath, arrayOfFiles) {
    const files = fm.listContents(dirPath)
    var arrayOfFiles = arrayOfFiles || []
    files.forEach(function (file) {
        const clear = file.replace(/^(\.+)|.icloud/g, '');
        const fullpath = fm.joinPath(dirPath, clear)
        if (fm.isDirectory(fullpath)) {
            arrayOfFiles = allFiles(fm, fullpath, arrayOfFiles)
        } else {
            arrayOfFiles.push(fullpath)
        }
    })
    return arrayOfFiles
}

function download(fm, array) {
    for (index in array) {
        const file = array[index];
        fm.downloadFileFromiCloud(file)
    }
    let n = new Notification()
    n.title = "Téléchargement dossier iCloud"
    n.subtitle = folder
    n.body = array.length + " Fichiers en cours de téléchargement"
    n.schedule()
}

download(fm, allFiles(fm, folder))


--------------------------------------------

It asks you to pick a folder, 
it then list all files and stores,
when it meets a folder,  it loops itself and stores paths in the same fat array.
Then it downloads everything.

Note :
When I tested I noticed  offloaded files have like a placeholder «.icloud» extension.
As it’s not really the real file name, it won’t work with "fm.downloadFileFromiCloud(file.txt.icloud)" so I added a dirty replace() that removes it.

Optimizations appreciated.
Happy scripting !

Widget that counts down to next event in calendar in hours and minutes?
Has anyone created a widget that counts down to the next event/ meeting in their calendar? I’m new to Scriptable so thought I’d ask in case something already exists.

I’m not looking for a countdown where you input a date - I would like something that syncs with my calendar (and updates if a meeting changes/ is cancelled).

I’m currently using a Spark app widget, but the sync is very iffy. Other than that it’s exactly what I’m hoping for - https://imgur.com/a/WDR7Tfp

Blank widget icons?
Are there any Scriptables to add blank icons to my Home Screen, as space fillers?

I know about apps for this purpose, but I don’t like that they basically use cutouts of wallpaper to make it happen.  Predicting icon position is hard.

Surely Scriptable can leverage actual transparency?

New Scriptable hub to collect information, code snippets and interesting widgets around Scriptable
Hey guys,

I want to start a centralized place where all information in the context of scriptable will come together.  
often I'm looking to get some help about scriptable, but often there are no examples or code snippets which I could adapt to my problem.

So there I am thinking about code snippets for scriptable, examples for widgets and other useful links. Maybe you have some more ideas for topics in this hub.

[https://github.com/wickenico/scriptable-hub](https://github.com/wickenico/scriptable-hub)  


For me Scriptable is one of the best apps for iOS and I want to grow the community and help others to create more beautiful and helpful widgets!

If you have ideas for content, code snippets or widgets you love just let me know right here in the comments or on the issues tab at GitHub :)   
Everyone is welcome to be a part of it.  


Maybe we can build it analogous to this similar page:

Script.complete() error in Shortcuts
Hi I know this might sound weird but since there is no action in shortcuts for checking if you have LTE on or off, I wrote myself a workaround with the knowledge I have. So I came up with this [Script](https://www.icloud.com/iclouddrive/0GuYcHVEYLo0p_6DPoGlTOFIg#Check_Internet_Connection).
After I upgraded to iOS 15, shortcuts will return an error that says "Script completed without presenting a UI, triggering a text to speak or outputting a value. You can manually call Script.complete()…"
Now if you look at the script, I should be outputting a value plus I AM calling Script.complete().
What did I do wrong? Is there a better workaround for my problem?
I would deeply appreciate any help.

So, widgets with clocks like I have in Widgetsmith work fine. But when I try to make one in Scriptable it takes several minutes to update. What am I doing wrong and why is it different?

Not much of a coder and this is referring to the Daily Logs V2 widget (created by u/randomo_redditor). I’m trying to set a background image for the widget without being prompted to select it from my camera roll every time I run it. Is this possible and if so what’s the code I need? I’ve attached the area of the code that I think controls this in the comments.

Thanks in advance

I found some library in JavaScript for doing this, such as rgbaster, but that library relies on html canvas to work and there is no such thing in scriptable (or am I missing something?). Any suggestion would be appreciated!

Scriptable loading indicator keeps spinning when running script
My script loads a html page (175KB) and then loads it into a WebView to run a javascript on it.

The javascript is simply supposed to find an element by Id. 

&#x200B;

The log shows an error and the loading indicator at the bottom left keeps spinning:

    2021-11-06 13:28:41: ReferenceError: Can't find variable: d3

&#x200B;

The script after loading the webpage:

    let res = await request.loadString();
    const wv = new WebView();
    const js = `
      const ret = document.getElementById("area_content");
      completion(ret);
    `;
    await wv.loadHTML(res);
    const result = await wv.evaluateJavaScript(js, true);
    log(result)

The ReferenceError stays even after I delete all the javascript code inside the variable js.

Did anyone else experience this and knows how to solve it?

widgets can't be added to homescreen on iphone 13 mini?
Hi all, 

Treated myself to an iphone 13 mini yesterday, to replace my super old phone that died. Am super excited about the possibilities of scriptable yet... I can't seem to get any widgets to actually work.   


\- previews of widgets after running scripts in the scriptable app work fine

\- when adding a new widget to homescreen things already look weird on the run script page where you select the size of your widget-to-add: the size previews show white backgrounds instead of the background with the colourful icons against white. 

\- after adding the widget, it appears as a white square on the homescreen. Selecting edit widget does give the 'run script' dialogue. I believe it should be set to 'when interacting: open app'  for the widgets to show on the home screen, yet after choosing a script and returning to the home page, the white square remains. 

\- ticking the white square widget opens the scripts view in the scriptable app.   


What gives?   


Told my bf about scriptable and things are running just great on his iphone xs so I'm pretty sure I've got the steps right. Tried multiple scripts, none give joy. Restarted a few times now. I have occasionally seen the background with the colourful icons on the run script page, but then only for one size and not the others (once for the small, twice for the middle size widget) and things didn't magically start to work on those occasions. 

Any ideas are much appreciated.

Weather Cal (customize spacings / events)
Dear all,  


Just came across Weather Cal for IOS and thats once of the best widgets I've ever seen and easy to setup. I just come across two things that bother me: The unneccessary spacing in the EVENT part of the widget - there is way too much spacing between the Event heading (date) and the actual event title. I marked the unneccessary spacing in red .. is there any way to tighten that?

https://preview.redd.it/kjloc9gzt0y71.jpg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=939528e966597e4d7496df63795482453cb2c03a

In addition, is there any way to NOT display the time of the event? Except for all-day events, the widget always displays the time of the event although I set to display "none" in the preferences.   


Any ideas / suggestions?

Changing To Function Creates Error
I have this code that I would like to make a function. It should accept any colour and return a hex: 

```
let wv = new WebView()
await wv.loadHTML("<div id='d' style='color:red'></div>")
let data = await wv.evaluateJavaScript(`completion(window.getComputedStyle(document.getElementById('d')).color)`,true)
const rgbToHex = (rgb) => { const rgbExcludeFirst = rgb.split('rgb(')[1]; const rgbExcludeLast = rgbExcludeFirst.split(')')[0]; const rgbValueArray = rgbExcludeLast.split(','); return `#${rgbValueArray.map((x) => { const valAsInt = parseInt(x, 10); const hex = valAsInt.toString(16); return hex.length === 1 ? `0${hex}` : hex; }).join('')}`; };
```

However when I make it a function:

```
function colourToHex(c) {
let wv = new WebView()
await wv.loadHTML("<div id='d' style='color:"+c+"'></div>")
let data = await wv.evaluateJavaScript(`completion(window.getComputedStyle(document.getElementById('d')).color)`,true)
const rgbToHex = (rgb) => { const rgbExcludeFirst = rgb.split('rgb(')[1]; const rgbExcludeLast = rgbExcludeFirst.split(')')[0]; const rgbValueArray = rgbExcludeLast.split(','); return `#${rgbValueArray.map((x) => { const valAsInt = parseInt(x, 10); const hex = valAsInt.toString(16); return hex.length === 1 ? `0${hex}` : hex; }).join('')}`; };
return rgbToHex(data)
}
```

It throws an error: `Error on line 3: SyntaxError: Unexpected identifier 'wv'`. I am wondering how can I fix this.

Thanks for any help!

https://preview.redd.it/jtukn3oirby71.jpg?width=828&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=62334b4e718fc76568d2dd1fcb0cffe76e650e42

First of all setting it up is hard, but its just one time process. I don't know if there is any Indians here, so i am not directly sharing and explaining it as it would be waste of time if there is no indians here (Basically you need to Intercept airtel app traffic and get auth data for private api.). I will share and explain if someone needs it.

Can't run script in widget mac
Hello everybody, I’m pretty new to scriptable.  I wrote a little script that work when I run it in scriptable.  I want to run it in a widget but I can’t choose the script I want to run when I add a widget.  Do you have any idea?     Even by clicking on “Ok” it’s written “loading not possible”

HTML Widget
*Create Scriptable widgets with HTML-like syntax*

I made a script that allows users to create widgets with syntax similar to HTML. Here is my GitHub [page](https://github.com/Normal-Tangerine8609/Scriptable-HTML-Widget). I know there are some other scripts out there that do this but HTML Widget is slightly different and more simplistic.

 The script is pretty easy to use and supports almost all widget features. The main feature it does not support is the date element. 

Here is an example of a code and what it makes:

```
let json = await new Request("https://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts.json").loadJSON()
let post = json["data"]["children"][Math.floor((Math.random() * 10) + 2)]["data"]
let title = post["title"].replace(/</g,"&lt;").replace(/>/g,"&gt;")
let body = post["selftext"].replace(/</g,"&lt;").replace(/>/g,"&gt;")
let ups = post["ups"]
let awards = post["all_awardings"].length
let comments = post["num_comments"]
let url = post["url"]

let widget = await htmlWidget(`
<widget refresh-after-date="15" url="${url}">
 <text font="system-ui, 13" center-align-text>Showerthoughts</text>
  <spacer space="5">
  <text font="system-ui, 11" minimum-scale-factor="0.3">${title}</text>
  <text font="system-ui, 11" minimum-scale-factor="0.3">${body}</text>
  <stack center-align-content>
    <symbol named="arrow.up.circle.fill" image-size="11,11">
    <spacer space="2">
    <text font="system-ui, 11">${ups}</text>
    <spacer>
    <symbol named="star.circle.fill" image-size="11,11">
    <spacer space="2">
    <text font="system-ui, 11">${awards}</text>
    <spacer>
    <symbol named="message.circle.fill" image-size="11,11">
    <spacer space="2">
    <text font="system-ui, 11">${comments}</text>
  </stack>
</widget>
`)
Script.setWidget(widget)
widget.presentSmall()
Script.complete()

Now and then I dream of making Scriptable 2.0 where everyone can write ‘plugins’ that bridge Swift to JavaScript. Possibly through PRs in a public repo. That would be so cool.

Scriptable on Mac 💻
hi js friends, i use scriptable a lot mainly in the [Beta for Mac](https://scriptable.app/mac-beta/) (on intel) and I love it! only annoying is the bug at "File/Folder Bookmarks" which isn’t possible without the app crashes And there is no AutoComplete bar at Scripting. Is someone here who’s using it on a intel Mac too?
What do you think does the alpha version will ever go live in the Mac App-Store?
i haven't heard from the developer about it in a while.

Align Stack To Left
I am trying to align the `redStack` (text with red background) to the left of the widget, but have had no success with my current code:

```
let widget = new ListWidget()
widget.setPadding(0,0,0,0)
let mainStack = widget.addStack()
mainStack.setPadding(10,0,10,0)
let redStack = mainStack.addStack()
redStack.backgroundColor = new Color("#f00",1)
redStack.cornerRadius = 6
redStack.setPadding(2,2,2,2)
redStack.size = new Size(100,16)
let text = redStack.addText("Wake Up Sunshine")
text.font = new Font("Arial Rounded MT Bold",14)
text.lineLimit = 1
text.textColor = new Color("#fff",1)
text.minimumScaleFactor = 0.5
redStack.addSpacer(1)
widget.addSpacer()
widget.presentSmall()
```

Presently it returns a widget like [this](https://www.linkpicture.com/q/6EC0487F-0E39-4382-AC1F-FB13BDA7846F.jpeg), whereas I want to create something like [this](https://www.linkpicture.com/q/DD2403D6-C9D4-4CD2-BB3B-4602F1CA2700.jpeg). Thanks for all your help in advance.

Can't get tap to work ...stuck
I have a simple stocks widget as part of a larger combined widget. 

&#x200B;

I use drawcontext to populate its data, but I can't get the tap to work (i.e. open the required url). Works for all other part of my overall widget but strangely not for this. Must be doing something wrong or url taps don't work over drawcontext. Here is the code for someone who might spot the issue:

&#x200B;

const widget = new ListWidget()

let stockout = await stocks2()

Script.setWidget(widget)

widget.presentSmall() 

Script.complete()

&#x200B;

async function stocks2(column) { 

  let stocksInfo2 = await getStockData()  

  let stocksStack2 = widget.addStack()

  stocksStack2.layoutVertically()

  stocksStack2.cornerRadius = 12

  stocksStack2.size = new Size(150,120)

  stocksStack2.url = "[http://www.news.com.au](http://www.news.com.au)"

  let drawContext = new DrawContext();

  drawContext.size = new Size(150, 120)

  drawContext.opaque = false

  drawContext.setFont(Font.boldSystemFont(12))



  for(j=0; j<stocksInfo2.length; j++) { 

let currentStock2 = stocksInfo2\[j\];

	drawContext.setTextColor([Color.red](https://Color.red)())

	var addspace, addspace2 = 0

drawContext.drawText(currentStock2.symbol.substring(0,3), new Point(10, 4 + j\*13))	

	drawContext.drawText(currentStock2.price, new Point(65 - (currentStock2.price.length-4)\*7, 4 + j\*13))

drawContext.drawText(currentStock2.changevalue, new Point(110 + addspace2, 4 + j\*13))	

  }



  stocksStack2.backgroundImage = drawContext.getImage()

  [//stocksStack2.backgroundImage.size](//stocksStack2.backgroundImage.size) = new Size(150, 120)

 }  

 

  

async function getStockData() {

  let stocks = null;

  stocks = \[ "[TRS.AX](https://TRS.AX)", "[BHP.AX](https://BHP.AX)"\]

  let stocksdata = \[\];

 

  for(i=0; i< stocks.length; i++)

  {

let stkdata = await queryStockData(stocks\[i\].trim());

let price = stkdata.quoteSummary.result\[0\].price;

RegEx working in Scriptable code, but not inside WebView javascript of the same script
Hi!

I have no idea what the problem is here, to be honest.

The following script matches an input string with a RegEx and logs the result. Simple.

But it gives two different results depending on whether the code is run in the script or inside a WebView using evaluateJavaScript()

Am I missing something?

    var input = "FooBar Examplestring 4:34 - 12:30";
    var matches = input.match(/\d{1,2}:\d{2}/g);
    log(matches);
    const wv = new WebView();
    const js = `
          var input = "FooBar Examplestring 4:34 - 12:30";
          var matches = input.match(/\d{1,2}:\d{2}/g);
          log(matches);
    `;
    const resultObject = await wv.evaluateJavaScript(js, true);

The result in the Log:

    2021-11-18 08:58:47: ["4:34","12:30"]
    2021-11-18 08:58:47: <null>

Simple Button Click
I am new to shortcuts! I am trying to load a webpage and then click a button on that webpage. I have been reading on here and stackoverflow that you cannot do this without using scriptable.

So I downloaded scriptable but when I try to run the following code on scriptable the webpage will load but nothing will happen. I tried to use query selectors as well but the link I want to click (follow link button) is under a “::before” tag and I think that is causing some issues selecting it

I also cannot print or use alert with this JavaScript so it’s been hard to debug on my own.

How to show ShareSheet with URL incl. Title?
When sharing e.g. a Tweet from the Twitter app, the ShareSheet comes up with:

    Title of Tweet
    URL of Tweet

I'd like this to be shared to Scriptable and have a script modify the URL slightly and open another ShareSheet with the modified URL. How can I do this?

When I do this:

    var url = args.urls[0];
    url = url.replace('aaa', 'zzz');
    ShareSheet.present([url]);

the ShareSheet comes up with the URL as string, not even a normal URL. How can I turn it into an URL and add a title?

Simple Daily Journal app made with Scriptable
Hi guys just like to share a simple journal app I made using scriptable. Everyday a new blank page would get generated where I can write my entry. Its then saved to iCloud as a text file automatically. Curious if anyone has also made something similar.

People often ask if Data Jar can be run from the terminal on macOS. I could support that but often people don't know that a shortcut can be from the terminal and that shortcut can use Data Jar. Here's how that can be done.

How to pass local video into a video tag?
I’ve been trying to work with the YouTube PiP shortcut as a starting point with this, as I’m trying to pass a local video to use with PiP, but am unable to present a local video as a URL that can be used as the input for the video tag src attribute.

I have a janky solution right now that doesn’t use scriptable, but it requires safari to be opened and the user has to manually specify the video by interacting with the webpage. I want to be able to pass the video programmatically without the need to specify it manually.

Is it even possible to use a local video like this, or does it need to be saved to iCloud first or something?

Exception for the quality of background image
as far as i know, Scriptable limits the quality of any imported image when size of the image exceeds about 500*500(px).  I understand the point of the developer, which is the way to keep widget from memory drain.  However, since many users enjoy scriptable widgets fetching their transparent background, It seems quite disappointing to use widgets...

Script for modyfing xattr inside iPhone Photos app / files
Hi guys, 

I've migrated from Android to iOS and I'm trying to migrate all of my media. I've already dealt with converting them to HEIF but I'm struggling now with one thing. I've noticed that in iOS 15 Photos app is showing from which app your image / video was saved. I find it very handy and I'd like to import that information into all my imported media. I've noticed that this information is being stored in xattr attribute and that scriptable have the ability to insert xattr into files via an API but I have no idea how to start with this as I've never used JS (Imma c# guy). Is it possible for someone to guide me on this issue and say if it's even possible?   


I also had an idea with modifying iphone backup with the help of iMazing 2 as I can get the Photos database from there but would that be doable as well?

So, I never upgraded iCloud to the “new” iCloud Drive before. Today I did, and when I opened Scriptable afterwards, all my scripts are gone! :( 

If I create a new one, I see it in the “Files”-app, under the new iCloud Drive->Scriptable folder, but I can’t find any trace of my old scripts. 

Are they gone for good?

Just like to share a simple daily expense and income tracker app made purely with Scriptable that  I use everyday. I was looking around for a money tracker app in the app store but all the apps I found simply did too much for my purposes. All where a bit of overkill for my daily needs so I decided to make my own.  Scriptable to the rescue 😁

For northern Europe, [met.no](https://met.no) has IMO the best weather data.

There is an api under [https://api.met.no/](https://api.met.no/) which is used by awesome Android apps like [https://meteogramwidget.com/](https://meteogramwidget.com/) . Unfortunately I haven't seen anything like that in iOS with [met.no](https://met.no) data.

Do you know any Scriptable scripts or apps using that api?

Any chance WidgetKit TimelineProvider is getting implemented in Scriptable?
Is there any chance, we will get support for Widget TimelineEntries in Scriptable? 
Would be very handy for Calendar/Weather/Time Widgets, if you could pre-fabricate the widget and update it that way more ofthen and better timed then with the limted full refresh.

For those who don‘t know (I will include myself here):
With WidgetKit TimelineProvider you can generate multiple TimelineEntries.
Let‘s say, you got a Calendar Widget. You know, in one hour the current event will be over and does not need to be displayed anymore. You could now just wait for the widget to refresh again OR you could generate a future widget, that will be displayed in one hour and will show a refreshed view just in time, when the event is over.

This would allow for more widget „refreshes“ while actually refreshing them less. :)
Also you can set a specific time to use the next widget entry, without waiting for iOS limited way of doing it.

The most difficult part about implementing search in Runestone was providing highlighted code snippets in the search results. They’re essentially a peek into the underlying NSAttributedString used by the text view. They’ll be available in the open source framework.

I’m trying to basically show a dashboard instead of opening each app individually. But when you tap on the message it opens that app so you can reply.

Converting HTML to plain text in a Scriptable script
Hello. I am creating a script which uses WebView to obtain the HTML of some links that contain some content in which I would like to search for certain regular expressions, but I would like to convert the HTML to plain text to make the search easier.  Might someone have any idea how I might go about doing this in a Scriptable script?

TIL about @sourcegraph and it turns out it’s a great way to find examples on how to build scripts for @scriptableapp.

This link shows 465 JavaScript code snippets containing “Script.complete()” and many (if not all) of those are Scriptable scripts.

How to measure real width of text?
Hi. First up sorry for having so many questions but I’m currently working on something that could become really great. (I’ll post it here when it’s done)

What I would like to know is if we can measure the real width if a string. It should take the font and text size into account. 

My use case is this: 
I have a UITable() with many rows (fixed height) and within them a cell with text (title and subtitle). Now I want title always being just one line but if the string is too long it makes two lines automatically. I didn’t find a way to set a line limit for this, so my thought process is that I need to cut the string at the right position and add “…” . That’s what I need the real width for because if I use .length, sometimes there are more “i”s, sometimes more “w”s. And then the result would look not as good.

The alternative I’ve come up with would be to measure each character by hand and letting a function go through each one and add them together. It is an option but I would rather not do that if there are better ways.

Any help is appreciated! Thank you!

The next beta build of Runestone will add support for a few more programming languages.  That includes Swift, one of the most requested languages since I started the beta.

The Swift Tree-sitter grammar is written by @alexpinkus👇

Still torn on the pricing model for Runestone. Part of me is like

“This is the simplest possible text editor. Why would anyone even pay for this?”

And then another part of me is like

“I’ve worked on this in my spare time for over a year. It has to cost _something_.”

People who are kindly helping me test Runestone:

What is the maximum one-time IAP you would buy to unlock all features currently in the beta builds?

I’m not yet sure what would be locked behind a paywall but likely several settings and possibly some languages.

Trying to make the keyboard dismiss interactively in Runestone by setting keyboardDismissMode = .interactive on the scroll view but the transition looks horrible when using an input accessory view.

The screen recording is from a minimal example app. https://t.co/4qpgndIlMJ

Based on the results in this poll I think that $10 is the right price for unlocking all features in Runestone. Many people answered $0 - $5 but I'm almost convinced that's too little for it to make sense for me. https://t.co/X00SOkWG9M

Might have found a way to improve the performance of Runestone significantly.

Instead of rendering lines in -draw(_:) on UIView, I’ll render them to an image and cache that. That way a line is rendered less often.

Needs much more testing but this could be quite an improvement.

I’m mostly testing performance in Runestone with files at 3 - 5 MB. I consider that to be large files in everyday use. However, now and then I test with this 26 MB JSON file and as long as that can be opened and highlighted this fast, then I think the performance is good enough. https://t.co/sGpiX6HrYo

How do you find Runestone’s app icon? I’ve spent so much time and energy on this app that I don’t want to risk launching with an app icon that people hate. Polls are anonymous so please be honest 😊

I can’t add images to tweets with polls so the app icon is in the next tweet.

I wouldn’t use SwiftUI for core parts of a complex app yet but it’s safe to say that Runestone wouldn’t have so many settings if it wasn’t for SwiftUI. It’s so simple to build settings screens that look decent with SwiftUI.

Now my problem is that I don't always workout on exactly the same days each week so I don't want to make it date based. I was hoping to be able to have a dedicated button for going to my next workout, and maybe even one for increasing/decreasing the weight, but I would want to just have these buttons send HTTP requests to my server and then refresh the widget, instead of opening a link. [https://github.com/andyngo/conversable-for-scriptable](https://github.com/andyngo/conversable-for-scriptable) <- I came across this example which does something very similar but again, it just opens a link, which will take me off my home page.

Formatting time
Hello everyone,

I‘m currently having an understanding issue with time stamp formatting, and was hoping one of you could help me.

The situation is as follows: I’m receiving a json file with a start and an end time in the 'yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss.sssZ' format, and want to simply display the two times like 'hh-mm - hh-mm' format. I’ve tried the following (data is the json object I receive through the API):

'
const startTime = new Date();
startTime = data[0].startTime

const line1 = list.addDate(startTime)
line1.applyTimeStyle()
'

This code fails at the list.addDate part, so I’m assuming the startTime isn’t a Date object anymore after I have written the data from the json into it?

Has anyone an idea how to solve this? Is my approach a good way or is there a simpler option?

Thank you very much!

Photos backup script?
What would be the best way to achieve automated photo backup to a private cloud storage? 

I prepared a URL which will accept the photos uploaded to it (with POST request). My roadblocks atm:

\- I need access to all photos (not just last x photos)

\- I need to be able to keep track of all the photos - to know which ones have already been backed up

\- the script should run regularly in the background / without user interaction. 

Is this achievable with Scriptable/Shortcuts combo?

How do you make two left-aligned columns (stacks) in a widget?
Hey all! I just found Scriptable today and have been enjoying using it to make some widgets. I'm having a hard time with what seems like a simple layout. Maybe someone here can help me out. How do I make two columns both left-aligned. Meaning that content added in the left column almost touches the left side of the widget, and the content added in the right column is aligned with the center of the widget. I've tried adding a spacer in between, but that pushes the right column too far right.

Thanks for any help!

Here's the code I tried:

    let w = new ListWidget()
    w.setPadding(0, 0, 0, 0)
    
    let main = w.addStack()
    
    let leftStack = main.addStack()
    let rightStack = main.addStack()
    
    leftStack.addText("Left Stack")
    rightStack.addText("Right Stack")
    
    leftStack.borderColor=Color.red()
    leftStack.borderColor=Color.blue()
    rightStack.borderWidth=3
    rightStack.borderWidth=3
    
    Script.setWidget(w)
    Script.complete()
    w.presentMedium()

I’m playing around with u/randomo_redditor’s amazing CalendarEventsWidget, and for some reason if I change the font to semiboldSystemFont the font size goes really small and won’t change. When the font is set to Menlo or any other font the font size will change.

I’ve not come across this with the System Font before and I’m not sure how to fix it. Could it be something to do with drawing an image? I haven’t used draw before.

widget.backgroundGradient = await HTMLGradient("to left, red, green, blue")
widget.presentSmall()
```

But it can get more complex like:

```
const widget = new ListWidget()
widget.backgroundGradient = await HTMLGradient("45deg, rgb(50,22,90), green 20%, blue-hsl(60, 50%, 50%)")
widget.presentSmall()
```

How to control alignment for a widget
Working on a widget and would like to get it to align to top and left side, even if there is not enough content to fill the widget.  When I have a enough content, it looks good, but as in this case, it doesn’t look right.  Is this the normal behavior or I am missing something with alignment?     Something like this is the goal:

Spent the evening splitting the repository for Runestone into two repositories: One with the Swift package that’ll be open source and one with my app that’ll be kept private.

Feels great! This is a milestone along the way to open source the Runestone framework 😃

Got the pipeline for Runestone’s documentation up and running. Get a sneak peek here:

https://t.co/L2WUd2RQLn

Turned out to be very easy to set up. A workflow on GitHub Actions generates the docs, commits the changes and Netlify deploys the docs. All with the press of a button.

I’m very interested to hear from people who are offering commercial licenses for their open source frameworks. Does it work for you? What’s the process for getting one? Any information on pricing?

Not saying I’ll go this route with Runestone but I’ll at least explore the option.

Online Go iOS Notifier - Widgets
&#x200B;

I have just created a simple widget for iOS that constantly checks if it your move.

https://preview.redd.it/rd9c15hwzpc81.jpg?width=597&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=da412da182ba0e3236c8a3359f8ec315c292108d

Steps:

1. Install scriptable - [https://scriptable.app](https://scriptable.app/)
2. Download OGS Notifier.js from GitHub - [https://github.com/ttsantos/Scriptable-examples](https://github.com/ttsantos/Scriptable-examples)
3. Add scriptable widget to the screen

3.1 Select script OGS Notifier

3.2 Add your params to the args (example: {"username":"ttsantos","game":40471380} )

Widget will tell you if we are waiting or it is our move.

Any doubts let me know.

Thinking about having Runestone localized to more languages. What’s everyone’s favorite localization service these days? My top priorities are:

1. Easy to use for people helping me out localizing the app.
2. An API that lets me fetch strings with a script.
3. Not too pricey.

How can i add queries to request for Parse(back4app) server
Hi! I am trying to make a request to a Parse Platform Server. The Request in generel is working but now im trying to limt the response by  querying my request. From Parse Documentation Queries should be made by sending the query in the body of the "get" request like: --data-urlencode 'limit=10'. I cant get it to to work, i always get an Error : "Recourse exceeds maximum size". 

    async function getNewTowers() {
       const url = "https://parseapi.back4app.com/classes/Towers";
       let headers = {"X-Parse-Application-Id": "ID","X-Parse-REST-API-Key": "Key"}
       const req = new Request(url)
       req.headers = headers
       //let data = {"limit":"1"}
       //req.body = JSON.stringify(data)
       //req.body = "limit=1"
       rep.addParameterToMultipart('limit', '1')
       const apiResult = await req.loadJSON() 
       return { Cameroun: apiResult.results[apiResult.results.length-1].Cameroun, DRC: apiResult.results[apiResult.results.length-1].DRC };
       }

Above you can see the different versions i tried, result is always the error. Thanks for any help!

The text/code editors I've tried don't really seem to handle right-to-left languages. This includes VS Code, Nova, Atom and Textastic. I'm not sure what the right thing to do is. Maybe I shouldn't handle RTL at all since it's often mixed with LTR in apps like Runestone.

Is there a count function for arrays?

Trying to find a way to count the number of times an object appears in an array. 

If not, does anyone have a while statement that creates the count?

Const count = account.data[x].name

I can input a number into x and it will output the name, but I would like to leave out the x and just have it count the times it sees name in the array.

Error help
Hey guys, I’ve been working on getting a script to work for a weather widget for my home page. I’m a novice to JavaScript, but have been able to mostly stumble my way through things to success until now. I’m getting an “Error on line 111: SyntaxError: Unexpected end of script”, but the thing is - my script ends on line 110. The script mostly came from [this post](https://reddit.com/r/iOSsetups/comments/sgz89u/new_to_ios_loving_it_so_far/), and I’ve added some from the “Weather Cal Widget Builder” from Scriptable’s gallery. I was getting this error before adding any lines from the Weather Cal script. Any help would be stellar. 

Here’s the [script](https://www.icloud.com/iclouddrive/0cd6HdkPSo3yZeW5ah8c4j7fg#Widget_thingy), if you want to take a look.

Add time of event to widget
So here I am, no scripting experience at all.

Managed to "build" some script that displays me a custom widget wallpaper.

Now I want to add the information of an event of a calendar matching some conditions:

1.	Only one specific calendar should be considered
2.	Only the event from today should be displayed (there is just one per day)
3.	First line, it should display the day from today
4.	Second line, I'd like to see "beginning time - ending time" separated by " - "

Final result should look like this:
**Sunday
21:45 - 22:15**

The whole block should be displayed in the bottom 1/3 of the widget.

How do I do this? Sorry for the dumb question! Willing to learn!

Visual indicator of HomeKit switch state on Home Screen?
Wondering if there's a way to have a quick visual indicator for the state of a HomeKit / Homebridge switch on iOS?

Use case is: a switch is on/off depending if someone is home or not (state is detected automatically from Home). I'd like an icon or widget on my Home Screen to see if that switch is on or off.

I think this could be done with some combination of Shortcuts and Scriptable? Right now I have an iOS Shortcut icon on my Home Screen that I can press to get the state of the switch, but I'd like if the icon changed colors based on the state of that switch.

Ideas?

ScriptMerge: Merge your imported modules into your script so you can share one file!
Hi all, 

I’ve been working on a project on and off for the last couple months that compacts all the imported modules into one file. What that means is that you can use other people’s libraries through `importModule` calls and still provide a single file once you’ve finished developing your script. 

Some quick features
 - minification
 - a GUI and class API
 - module variable renaming

New post on /r/Scriptable
https://reddit.com/r/Scriptable/comments/srsrqo/how_to_extend_native_prototypes/
How to extend native prototypes
I've created a set of prototype extensions of native objects*, that I use in multiple Scriptable scripts (e.g. `Number.prototype.isPrime`).  In Node (or [play.js](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/play-js-javascript-ide/id1423330822), another wonderful iOS scripting app, which uses node... mostly, but unfortunately does not integrate with Shortcuts), I'd simply call `require('./extensions')`, the file would extend the prototypes of the global objects and all would be well.

Scriptable doesn't work that way.  Each file is its own sandbox with its own version of native objects.  If I `importModule('./lib/extensions')` from a script, within extensions.js, itself, I can type `(17).isPrime()` and it will work, but within the script that imports it, `isPrime` is still `undefined`.

The solution I found is a little hacky, but it's the cleanest I could come up with.

**lib/extensions.js**

```js
const [
  _Number = Number,
  _Array = Array,
  // ...
] = []

// used to ensure each type only gets extended once per sandbox
const extended = new Set()

const ex = (type, fn) => {
  if (!extended.has(type)) {
    fn()
    extended.add(type)
  }
}

const extendNatives = module.exports = ({
  Number = _Number,
  Array = _Array,
  // ...
}) => {
  ex(Array, () => {
    _Object.assign(Array.prototype, {
      unique() {
        return Array.from(new Set(this))
      },
    })

    _Object.defineProperty(Array, 'last', {
      get() {
        if (!this.length) {
          return undefined
        }
    
        return this[this.length - 1]
      },
      set(value) {
        if (!this.length) {
          throw new Error(
            'Cannot assign to last of empty array'
          )
        }
    
        return (this[this.length - 1] = value)
      },
    })
  })

  ex(Number, () => {
    // ...
  })
}

extendNatives({})
```

**My Scriptable Script**

```js
importModule('./lib/extensions')({
  Number,
  // only need to pass in the natives you actually use in the script
})

console.log((17).isPrime())
```

Logger, A module for handling logs
So this is my first post here.

I thought that I would share a scriptable module I created, when I began developing widgets for scriptable. I needed a way to log errors and other information when the script runs in a widget. So I made **Logger**, a simple module which saves logs to the filesystem, which then can be exported. Logger can be used as a substitute for the console object, as messages passed to logger also gets printed to the console.

Github repo here [Scriptable Logger](https://github.com/MidnightRocket/Scriptable-Logger).

This has helped me develop widgets. So I hope this can be useful for someone developing widget too, or other scripts.

Scriptable widget with table layout
Hi everybody,  I am looking for a way to make a widget which produces a similar table layout (without images) as the attached, FireyFeeds widget.     At the moment I try my best with the following code, but no table cells are created. Even worse, the two items are just aliged beside each other.  I highly appreciate if you could give me a hint or...

Unable to get DOM element that is loaded dynamically
Hi everyone. I have some entry level JavaScript experience, and I’ve been trying to get a script to login and click some buttons on a website, but have reached a tough hurdle where I am unable to find an element using `document.getElementByID()` or `document.contains()`  
 and remove it using `.remove()`  


With each, the console returns the element as “null”. I have tried `setTimeout`, which does delay properly, but the DOM nodes I’m interested in removing only appear after I present the web view.

See my code below (code that is specific to website has been removed for confidentiality):

    var wv = new WebView(); await wv.loadURL("loginwebsite.com");  await wv.evaluateJavaScript(` var emailTextBox = document.getElementById("username"); emailTextBox.value = "xxxxxx" var pwTextBox = document.getElementById("password"); pwTextBox.value = "yyyyyy";  var submitBtn = document.querySelector("body > form > div.ping-buttons > a");  submitBtn.click();`);  await wv.waitForLoad();  await wv.loadURL("SecondWebsite.com");  await wv.waitForLoad();  await wv.evaluateJavaScript(`function removeDivs () { var divOne = document.getElementById('mydialog'); var divTwo = document.getElementById('mydialog-cover'); divOne.remove(); divTwo.remove();  }  setTimeout(removeDivs, 5000);`);   await wv.present(fullscreen=false);  

I also tried a different technique for waiting for the elements to appear before trying to remove them, as shown below:

    await wv.evaluateJavaScript(`function removeDivs () { var divOne = document.getElementById('mydialog'); var divTwo = document.getElementById('mydialog-cover');   if (document.body.contains(divOne)) { divOne.remove();   } else {   setTimeout(removeDivs, 300);  }   if (document.body.contains(divOne)) { divTwo.remove();   } else {   setTimeout(removeDivs, 300);  } }  removeDivs();`);  

Neither work as anticipated. When the web view presents, even after a 5 second timeout, the original webpage’s JavaScript THEN runs on the page, and the divs I’m looking for are created.

Perhaps there i...

Is there a way to put another app's memo in the widget?
I'm using a memo app called Bear.

In the iOS basic widget, I can view one of the memo lists in real time in the widget.

However, because I want to change the design, I want to create a script that allows me to view memos in real time like a basic widget using scriptable.

If I use xcallback, the app opens. I wonder if there is another way.

If i leave this out.

    `
    const SHORTCUTNAME = "Random-Wallpaper-Home";
    const BASEURL = "shortcuts://run-shortcut?name=";
    Safari.open(BASEURL + encodeURI(SHORTCUTNAME)); `

The

`Console.log(‘test’);`
Displays every 5 sec but for some reason if i put in the code above. Every thing goes blank.

    ` "use strict" 
    let wv = new WebView();
    await wv.loadHTML("");
    let js = `
    const run = setInterval(runShortCut, 5000);
    function runShortCut() {
    const SHORTCUTNAME = "Random-Wallpaper-Home";
    const BASEURL = "shortcuts://run-shortcut?name=";
    Safari.open(BASEURL + encodeURI(SHORTCUTNAME));
    Console.log(‘test’)
      }
    `;

    let result = await wv.evaluateJavaScript(js, true) ; `
Basically im trying to run a shortcut every 30 min.



If i run the below code, it runs the short cut but it opens the short cut app which i don’t want. I herd if use a widget it doesn’t open the app. I just don’t know to run the widget with code.

    `
    const SHORTCUTNAME = "Random-Wallpaper-Home";
    const BASEURL = "shortcuts://run-shortcut?name=";
    Safari.open(BASEURL + encodeURI(SHORTCUTNAME)); 
    
    `


Anyway I cant get `setInterval` to work with the code above. even if I can somehow get it to work .  It opens the shortcut app.

    w.present()

Here is my Scriptable code. I am trying to allow the code to open a website in full screen, but this is not working. I thought the third parameter is a boolean for fullscreen, but it shows in normal view. Any help?

Help with a script, want to add if/then and it won’t work. (Widget is to follow my Type one diabetic kid’s blood sugar levels)
I have a script that reads a website that reads my son’s continuous glucose monitor readings sent to the cloud (he’s a Type 1 diabetic). 

The script reads fine but because I’m a bit (a lot) extra, I want emojis or text to pop up when he’s a certain reading. It’s not wanting to work and I’ve done it a bazillion times. It does list.addText but I can’t get it to be conditional. I did if (glucose = 100) {list.addText(“words”);} and it doesn’t work.  Does this script “know” it’s a number or is it just fetching the data? 

Also - and this is the longest shot *ever* - does anyone know how to get his script to read his diabestie’s website and have an if/then condition when they have the same reading? 

Here’s the script: https://niepi.org/2020/10/25/ios-14-nightscout-widget/ if that helps. 

And yes, I’m fully aware how awesome technology is.

Widget settings page?
I've made a small widget that displays upcoming running, skiing, cycling or multisport events in Norway.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/s6qzpq0572s81.png?width=425&format=png&auto=webp&s=7ecee2a8dd547cf6d3b57c2d3da54fb88afa7c49

Script on [GitHub](https://github.com/Lanjelin/scriptable/blob/main/KondisWidget.js)

It fetches data on a 3 hour  interval and stores this to a cache-folder, as the external data is not updated often, and to reduce requests.

**Question 1:** The variables it uses to pull the data has to be set up directly in the scriptable-script, but I was wondering if there was a way for the end-user to just click a button (or run the script), and get presented with a settings-page/view? Something like this: [jsfiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/ga5d9jmo/)

The plan is to then store these settings to a file, and have the widget to use these when pulling data.

**Question 2:** Is it possible to differentiate two widgets running from the same scriptable-script?

I was hoping I'd make it possible to have two widgets running each it's own config, displaying different info, eg. one for running and one for cycling events.

When app opens, connect vpn and then switch back to that app.
I am trying to do something, but i am not sure if it is possible.  I am not much of a programmer...

What i want it:

\- when i open an app "textme", i would like it if my ProtonVPN would do a quick connect.  I can do this part already with the automation app.  But it will not switch back to textme afterwards.  Of course i need to tell it to ask before running, otherwise i end up in an endless loop. Switch back and then it goes to protonvpn all the time. 

&#x200B;

\- so, if there is a way to let say, if ProtonVPN is already connected, then do nothing and open Textme.  If proton is not open, then auto connect and then switch back to textme automatically.  Or if that cannot be done, then somehow, once ProtonVPN is connected, to switch back to Textme without it going into an endless loop of switching back to proton to reconnect.

&#x200B;

Thanks,

Just made a few custom SF Symbols for Runestone. I feel like something (a lot?) changed between SF Symbols version 2 and 3. It was a lot easier to create custom symbols than I recalled.

Concurrent API requests while looping through array of item numbers that are included in the url
I have an array of item numbers in a recipe 

let item = ["00031","00032","00033","68","61","44","00043","512"]

And this end-point returns ingredient names:

`https://bmpublicapi-prd.adifo.cloud/api/v1/Ingredients/${item}/descriptions`

Looping through the array and making the calls one by one is very slow. I’ve tried and tried to make Promise.all work but I get errors (typically the one where you can’t have an await inside a synchronous function) but the examples I’ve found have async outside of the function… All the examples I can find online use fetch and this seems to be part of what is tripping me up.

Has anyone done something like this in Scriptable before? I’d really appreciate any help.

So far I have tried finding a way to import it into scriptable but that was a dead end I also tried using some code I found on this subreddit that loaded html and basically took a photo of it but was unable to get it to work. I’m wondering if there is a better way I should go about it?

It took only 13 minutes from Runestone version 1.0 was submitted until Apple had approved 🤯

13 minutes for a 1.0 with an IAP! I can only think of two ways that can happen:
- By mistake 😬
- The reviewer have been on the beta 😄

https://reddit.com/r/Scriptable/comments/u8gw6r/how_do_i_set_addtextfield_as_a_number/
How do I set .addTextField as a number?
I'm trying to track my precious metal holding via a script. So far, I can display the actual prices via another script I wrote so thought this should be easy - add an input box at the start and change the output to multiply by the current cost. Not so easy it seems. I keep getting an error when multiplying by the current metal price (named 'tyler' in my script). I don't think the .addTextField sees my input as a number as it is coming out as undefined after the attempt at multiplication. I've added text fields in the following way:
    textFieldG.addTextField("Gold (oz)","").setDecimalPadKeyboard();
    textFieldG.addTextField("Silver (oz)","").setDecimalPadKeyboard();
    await textFieldG.present();
    var goldHolding = textFieldG.textFieldValue(0);
    var silverHolding = textFieldG.textFieldValue(1);

then I multiply like this:
    let goldText = goldHolding*tyler;

This gives me an undefined return.

(so that all the information is here 'tyler' is gained like this:
    let wv = new WebView();
    await wv.loadURL('https://www.abcbullion.com.au/price/feeds');
    let html = await wv.getHTML();
    log(html);
 
    const searchTerm = 'title="GOLD"><span class="value">';
    const regEx = new RegExp(`(${searchTerm})(.){7}`, 'gm');
    const string = html;
    const result = string.match(regEx);
    console.log(result[0]); // will log AUD price
    const tyler = result[0].charAt(33)+result[0].charAt(34)+result[0].charAt(35)+result[0].charAt(36)+result[0].charAt(37)+result[0].charAt(38)+result[0].charAt(39);
). I've put the whole code on [GitHub in case someone needs to see the lot](https://github.com/HelloSmithers/My-Gold-Holdings/blob/main/My%20Gold%20Holdings).  Thanks for the help.

So I went to create an organisation but the ‘Runestone’ name is taken. It’s a dead end 😒

So here’s something I just realized and that blew my mind 🤯

The Runestone beta began on May 5, 2021. Exactly a year later (May 5, 2022), Runestone will launch on the App Store. That’s entirely a conicidence! But what a perfect coincidence 👌😃

I’ve been working on Runestone, a very simple text editor for iOS, since December. It isn’t done yet but it’s getting there and I *think* I’m ready to get feedback from a few people 😬

Want to help me test my new app? Spots are limited for now. 👇

In [my post](https://www.reddit.com/r/shortcuts/comments/ua71ui/how_to_get_the_location_response_header) over in Shortcuts someone suggested that Scriptable would be able to get the `Location` header in the response.

As I'm not much of a JS developer how can I make an HTTP POST request with an XML file and then extract the `Location` header for use by the following Shortcuts action?

Can anyone help me out?

In Scriptable I have this:

var result = await req.loadString()

What would that be in vanilla JS?

document.write(xhr.responseText);

Just fixed a performance issue in Runestone where using “Replace All” to replace thousands of occurrences would cause the app to hang for seconds and ultimately crash. Now it replaces the occurrences in a split second 😌

Had this idea of using drag and drop to reorder lines in Runestone but I don’t even think I’ll finish the proof of concept. The drag and drop interaction will interfere with the default long press interaction to select text and I cannot compromise with default interactions.

Spent literally 30 seconds to run Runestone on macOS with Catalyst. It’s not perfect but it’s certainly not as bad as I had feared either. Maybe one day…

From running Runestone through @emergetools it’s clear that the Prettier.js languages are taking up a lot of disk space 😳

Can one have ‘favorite settings’? If so, these are my favorite settings in Runestone.

✨ Adjusting line height and kerning improves readability.
👀 Enabling line numbers and line selection makes navigation easier.
➡️ Disabling line wrapping makes it easier to grasp large files.

Managed to reduce the size of Runestone by ~8 MB. I optimised the images and refactored my Prettier framework so I only have to import the resources I actually need.

I started working on Runestone on Nov 29, 2020. I gave myself a month to make a proof of concept. If I had something I believed in by then, I'd finish the project, otherwise I'd discard it. Here's a tweet made one month later.

"[...] could actually be released on the App Store"

Runestone 1.0.2 is rolling out on the App Store now. Here are the release notes. Most notably the update fixes an issue where users, who were on the TestFlight beta, were unable to purchase Premium because the app behaved as if it had already been purchased.

Runestone is an excellent new code editor for iOS. Fast, fully usable in free mode, and a very reasonable one-time $10 for all features.

I especially like the integration of Prettier automatic code formatting 🪄 and its settings.

Question about versioning: The next version of Runestone comes with a few new settings and syntaxes. It also fixes a few bugs. The current version is 1.0.2.

Should the next version be 1.1.0 or 1.0.3? Strictly speaking there are new features (settings) but they’re minor.

Setting up notifications for NFT price tracker widget.
I've made a widget that tracks the floor price for select nfts.

I am trying to create a notification which will be triggered when the floor orice dips below a certain number, with no success.

I can provide the whole script upon need.

Calling a shortcut from a script using the x-callback-url protocol
Hello once again.  In trying to find the best way to call a shortcut from a script, I found documentation on the CallbackURL class.  I did a little research and discovered that the Shortcuts app is reported to support the x-callback-url protocol so I decided to try it.  In the script, I used lines such as the following:    let showMatchesShortcu...

The top crashes in Runestone comes from using UIkeyboardLayoutGuide. It seems like similar issues resulting in various odd crashes. Some causes by EXC_BAD_ACCESS, some caused by constraints becoming illegal when dismissing views, and some caused by UITraitCollection 🤷‍♂️

Script.complete() seems to not kill the script when run in app
Using the code below, you can see that the script execution is expected to stop before the preview of the widget is shown. This seems fine when used in a widget, but running in app, the preview still shows.  I’ve known this to operate this way for as long as I can remember, but I’m wondering if it is intended.  //set the filename of the image. E...

Getting a lot of requests for Runestone to show hidden files. I’d love to do that! Unfortunately, UIDocumentBrowserViewController doesn’t support showing hidden files. Really hoping that’ll change in a month 🤞

💡 Runestone tip: You can use the default Open File Shortcuts action to open a plain text file in Runestone.

Runestone is fab — Simon’s excelled with this. Solid 5-star rating in the App Store (🔥), and ranked 5th in dev tools today.

Worth checking out. (Also, if you buy the full version it unlocks something rather unexpected. Love that!)

To open an app every time I open the screen
Hi, 

Could I do that every time I opened the screen - I will see a specific app? Doesn't matter where I have been before I closed the screen.

Can I create a script for that?

Thanks!

Runestone have been out for a week and many people have reacted positively to the surprise you get after unlocking Premium. However, no one have mentioned the additional small “Easter egg” in the app. Maybe no one have found it or maybe it’s too boring for anyone to care 😄

what would i need to change to change my path from being loaded from icloud drive to “On My Iphone”?
Hi,

I followed this guide of an widget that shows the date and time on the widget that also uses an image in the background.

The problem is that the image is under my icloud drive and it needs to be redownloaded every couple hours, and when it isnt downloaded, it turns into a white screen, or the widget would say “script not found”.

what the widget looks like: https://imgur.com/a/09VFJr3


I copied the entire folder and moved it to “On My iPhone” so I wouldn’t need to redownload it all the time. I think I know where to change it, but i don’t know how I would specify the path.

First working version of the redesigned New File dialog in Runestone. This seems like a good balance between keeping file creation fast and lightweight while still aiding users in creating the right file.

I'm far from satisfied with Runestone's search ranking on the App Store for queries like "text editor". I realise it's a quite generic query but naturally I'd like Runestone to rank high on that. Anyone had luck doing SEO on the App Store and can point me to some resources?
