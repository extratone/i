# iTextEditors Submission Template

- [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/extratone/i/issues/204)

![DraftsExample](https://github.com/extratone/i/raw/main/images/itexteditorsexample.png)

This is a markdown-formatted adaptation of [**the submission form**](http://brettterpstra.wufoo.com/forms/ios-text-editors) for Brett Terpstra's [iTextEditors wiki](https://brettterpstra.com/ios-text-editors), created so that one can comfortably ponder their answer in their local text editor minus the anxiety of losing their progress because of a page reload or the pressure of having to complete the entirety in one sitting.

**Please note that it was *not* solicited or endorsed by Brett.**
