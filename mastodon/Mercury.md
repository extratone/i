Release Notes = Hey Folks!
Got a fairly big update coming your way this time. New in 2021.4 is:
- Drafts
Save your in-progress posts and return to them later.
- Delete and re-draft
Delete your posts and open them up in a new compose window to correct any typos of meanings. Any attached media will be kept and can be removed or added to when re-composing.
- Follower alerts
Get notifications when select followers post new statuses. With version 3.3.0 of Mastodon, you're able to selectively enable alerts to be notified when people you follow post a status. This option will be available in Mercury for people you follow if your instance supports this feature.
- Replies and thread view
When viewing a status' details, you can now switch between the thread and replies for that status.
- Keep CW posts open
This one does what it says on the tin. When you reveal text behind a content warning, scrolling away and coming back will not re-hide the text.
Other fixes:
- Fixed an issue that prevented logging in to Pleroma
- Cleaned up some UI things
- Hopefully fixed a background crash that would prevent the timelines from loading properly on launch
Thank you to everyone for all your support, questions and suggestions!
