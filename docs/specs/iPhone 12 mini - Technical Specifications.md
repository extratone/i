\* To identify your iPhone model number, see [support.apple.com/kb/HT3939](https://support.apple.com/kb/HT3939). For details on 5G and LTE support, contact your carrier and see [apple.com/iphone/LTE](https://www.apple.com/iphone/LTE/). Cellular technology support is based on iPhone model number and configuration for either CDMA or GSM networks.

1.  Available space is less and varies due to many factors. A standard configuration uses approximately 11GB to 14GB of space (including iOS and preinstalled apps) depending on the model and settings. Preinstalled apps use about 4GB, and you can delete these apps and restore them. Storage capacity subject to change based on software version and may vary by device.
2.  Size and weight vary by configuration and manufacturing process.
3.  iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 mini are splash, water, and dust resistant and were tested under controlled laboratory conditions with a rating of IP68 under IEC standard 60529 (maximum depth of 6 meters up to 30 minutes). Splash, water, and dust resistance are not permanent conditions and resistance might decrease as a result of normal wear. Do not attempt to charge a wet iPhone; refer to the user guide for cleaning and drying instructions. Liquid damage not covered under warranty.
4.  Data plan required. 5G, Gigabit LTE, VoLTE, and Wi-Fi calling are available in select markets and through select carriers. Speeds are based on theoretical throughput and vary based on site conditions and carrier. For details on 5G and LTE support, contact your carrier and see [apple.com/iphone/cellular.](https://www.apple.com/iphone/cellular/).
5.  Ultra Wideband availability varies by region.
6.  FaceTime calling requires a FaceTime‑enabled device for the caller and recipient and a Wi‑Fi connection. Availability over a cellular network depends on carrier policies; data charges may apply.
7.  Standard Dynamic Range video content only.
8.  Siri may not be available in all languages or in all areas, and features may vary by area. Internet access required. Cellular data charges may apply.
9.  All battery claims depend on network configuration and many other factors; actual results will vary. Battery has limited recharge cycles and may eventually need to be replaced by Apple service provider. Battery life and charge cycles vary by use and settings. See [apple.com/batteries](https://www.apple.com/batteries/) and [apple.com/iphone/battery.html](https://www.apple.com/iphone/battery.html) for more information.
10.  Wireless chargers sold separately.
11.  Testing conducted by Apple in September 2020 using preproduction iPhone 12 mini and iPhone 12 units and software and accessory Apple USB-C Power Adapter (20W Model A2305). Fast-charge testing conducted with drained iPhone units. Charge time varies with settings and environmental factors; actual results will vary.
12.  Use of eSIM requires a wireless service plan (which may include restrictions on switching service providers and roaming, even after contract expiration). Not all carriers support eSIM. Use of eSIM in iPhone may be disabled when purchased from some carriers. See your carrier for details. To learn more, visit [support.apple.com/kb/HT209044](https://support.apple.com/kb/HT209044).
13.  Wireless broadband recommended; fees may apply.
14.  In China mainland, you can use Apple Pay on the web in Safari only on compatible iPhone and iPad models using iOS 11.2 or later
15.  Data accurate as of product launch.
16.  Apple defines its restrictions on harmful substances, including definitions for what Apple considers to be “free of,” in the [Apple Regulated Substances Specification.](https://www.apple.com/environment/pdf/Apple_Regulated_Substances_Specification_Sept2018.pdf) Every Apple product is free of PVC and phthalates with the exception of AC power cords in India, Thailand (for two-prong AC power cords), and South Korea, where we continue to seek government approval for our PVC and phthalates replacement.

Some features may not be available for all countries or all areas. [View complete list](https://www.apple.com/ios/feature-availability/).
