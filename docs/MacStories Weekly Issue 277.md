### Using Focus in iPadOS 15 to Create an 'iOS Review Home Screen'

**Federico:** One of the major additions to iOS and iPadOS this year is Focus, which can be easily explained as a way for users to create their own custom Do Not Disturb modes and switch between them at different times of the day. As we detailed in [our iOS and iPadOS 15 overview](https://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-and-ipados-15-the-macstories-overview/), you can, for instance, create a Focus for work, another for personal downtime, and maybe one for when you're hitting the gym; each Focus can have a dedicated set of notification settings based on specific contacts and apps, and you can choose to activate it either manually or automatically via different criteria such as location. Focus lives in Control Center, and it incorporates previous standalone modes such as Do Not Disturb, [driving mode](https://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-11-the-macstories-review/23/#do-not-disturb-while-driving), and [Sleep mode](https://www.macstories.net/stories/sleep-tracking-in-watchos-7-and-ios-14-elevated-by-a-user-experience-driven-design/) – everything is part of Focus now, plus you can make your own. I already know this is going to be one of the highlights of my iOS 15 review later this year, and I think this feature is going to be *extremely* popular with all kinds of users.

But this is MacStories Weekly, so allow me to get nerdy for a few minutes and share a preview of how I've been using Focus on my iPad to create a personalized workspace for the iOS review.

As you probably know by now, the iPadOS Home Screen is getting a major revamp this year with the ability to freely place widgets anywhere, hide apps in the App Library, and reorganize multiple Home Screens (including re-arranging and deleting them) by long-pressing the page indicators above the dock. My favorite semi-hidden touch, however, is the fact that Focus also integrates with the Home Screen and lets you choose which pages you want to see when a specific mode is turned on. The idea is obvious enough: if you're at work, maybe you just want to see a Home Screen full of work apps and only get personal notifications from family members; if you're at home, you may want to hide that work-related Home Screen and mute emails and other threads from the office. The integration between Focus and Home Screen is seamless: once you've configured the pages you want to see for a specific Focus in Settings, as soon as you enable the Focus via Control Center, your Home Screen will automatically set itself up to display pages you've chosen; disable the Focus, and it'll come back to normal.

Choosing Home Screens for a Focus.

Furthermore all Focus modes can now be used as triggers for personal automations in the Shortcuts app. As with previous Do Not Disturb-based triggers, you can choose to run actions in Shortcuts when a Focus is turned on or off, and you can disable the manual conformation step so the automation will run on its own without requiring any input from you.

 [![](https://mcusercontent.com/9f4b80a35728f7271fe3ea6ff/images/1ab50712-7b44-2e87-ea24-a78ceefeab9d.png)](https://cdn.macstories.net/ivborw0kggoaaaansuheugaac50aaajwcayaaaakgq9xaaaacxbiwxmaaastaaaleweampwyaaam-1624018713243.png) 

Running an automation when a Focus turns on.

With all this in mind, I had an idea: what if I used Focus to create a dedicated "workspace" for the iOS review on my iPad Pro that combined notification settings, a custom Home Screen, and integration with time tracking via the [Timery](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/timery-for-toggl/id1425368544) app? It took me a few hours to put all this together a couple nights ago, but I'm very happy with the result, which you can see in its full glory below:

 [![](https://mcusercontent.com/9f4b80a35728f7271fe3ea6ff/images/47d9b817-61b9-abd3-6309-b393e406684e.png)](https://cdn.macstories.net/ivborw0kggoaaaansuheugaac50aaajwcayaaaakgq9xaaaacxbiwxmaaastaaaleweampwyaaam-1624017948335.png)

Enabling the Focus in Control Center.

There are a few interesting choices to unpack here, so let me explain. For starters, I've taken advantage of the ability to mix and match icons and widgets in iPadOS 15 to go all-in on widgets. I've been thinking a lot about actions I typically perform when I'm researching, writing, and editing the review, and I've tried to come up with a layout that puts quick access to certain functionalities front and center. For instance, you can see how I've installed multiple Timery widgets at the top of the page. There are four widgets to quickly start timers for the review tasks I'm dealing with now (sessions, research, writing, and admin work); later in the summer, I'll replace 'Sessions' with 'Editing' when the time comes to edit what I've written. Timery makes it easy to create widgets that start specific timers because it supports [inline widget configuration](https://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-and-ipados-14-the-macstories-review/4/#configuring-widgets), which is a technology I want to see more developers support to the same extent as Joe Hribar's excellent app. For example, the folks at [Todoist](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/todoist-to-do-list-tasks/id572688855) have done the necessary work to support a variety of widgets for viewing and creating tasks that can be configured with different parameters inline. I've added a large widget to view all tasks in the iOS Review project organized by sections (bottom left corner), a medium widget to view all tasks created from Obsidian based on a custom filter (bottom right corner), and two small widgets to create new tasks in the Research and Writing sections of the iOS Review project. These are views and actions I find myself repeatedly opening or performing in Todoist on my iPad, and it's great that iPadOS 15 lets me collect them all together as widgets on the same page.

 [![](https://mcusercontent.com/9f4b80a35728f7271fe3ea6ff/images/6eb5c586-97bb-fd6d-f476-739d2e42ccd8.png)](https://cdn.macstories.net/ivborw0kggoaaaansuheugaac50aaajwcayaaaakgq9xaaaacxbiwxmaaastaaaleweampwyaaam-1624019202277.png) 

Configuring one of the Todoist widgets.

You're probably curious about a few other aspects of this page, so here's a handy list for you:

-   No, I don't know exactly when iOS 15 is releasing. The countdown widget is based on a tentative date (September 15) I *imagined*, and it's powered by the [Countdowns](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/countdowns-event-day-counter/id917514700) app;
-   Review Ideas and Review Note are custom shortcuts that open a specific note and create new notes for the iOS Review folder in Obsidian, respectively. The second one uses the new [Files actions in Shortcuts](https://mailchi.mp/macstories/gehuio38o75gg385g38q5yq835gqouihgoiuqww) to create Markdown files in the Obsidian vault on my device.
-   The 'Shuffle Daft Punk' shortcut does exactly what it says: it takes my 'All Daft Punk' playlist in Apple Music (which contains all the Daft Punk albums) and shuffles it. This is a one-tap shortcut that puts me in the right mood for the review since Daft Punk's songs are perfect to concentrate and isolate myself from the rest of the world.
-   In the dock, I have more custom icons to reopen workspaces in Obsidian and run other MacStories-specific shortcuts.

There's one last technique I've implemented for this Focus mode, and that's the personal automation running in the Shortcuts app whenever I enable the iOS Review Focus in Control Center. This automation runs a single 'Run Shortcut' action, which invokes a shortcut I created beforehand to start a specific timer for the iOS review when I sit down to work at my iPad Pro. As soon as I enable the Focus in Control Center, a prompt is displayed onscreen with a list of timers to choose from; I like this approach so I never forget to start a timer when I work on the review.

Choosing a timer when Focus is enabled.

I'm already a big fan of Focus and its integration with different parts of iOS and iPadOS, from contacts and notifications to Home Screen and Shortcuts. I like what I've set up for the iOS review workspace so much, I'm now thinking about other Focus modes I could use – for instance, I want to make a custom driving mode without the restrictions of the default one, but I also want to create a 'Music Home Screen' for when I just want to listen to an album, and I'm also considering a Club MacStories page for when I'm fully focused on Club-related tasks and activities (this will make more sense in the near future). I have a feeling that Focus, along with Shortcuts, is going to be one of the fun chapters of the review this year, and I look forward to playing with it more.

Reeder is the RSS client where most of my reading and research begins.

**John**: I spend a lot of time in an RSS client each week, looking for things to cover on MacStories and keeping up with the latest on a variety of topics. However, no single RSS client has ever had the perfect mix of features for the way I work, although a few have come close. I use [Reeder](https://reederapp.com/) more than any other RSS client because dozens of little design touches make it my favorite reading experience on the greatest number of Apple platforms. Still, I prefer the way [ReadKit](https://readkitapp.com/) handles its iPad panels and the way it uses gestures to make navigating feeds effortless. At the same time, neither of those apps integrate [Inoreader's](https://www.inoreader.com/) saved search and other powerful features. I can work around many of the limitations by generating feeds inside Inoreader's web app for things like saved searches, Twitter searches, and email newsletters, but that solution doesn't work universally.

 [![](https://mcusercontent.com/9f4b80a35728f7271fe3ea6ff/images/8dfc0063-f1d3-4238-c775-28adb1a55ce4.png)](https://cdn.macstories.net/bb858dfa-6fa4-43cd-8fb1-5635e25412fe-1624018183149.png) 

ReadKit's full-screen mode is my favorite among RSS clients.

Historically, the differences between RSS clients haven't been a hindrance because I use an RSS sync service. That allows me to use multiple RSS clients. I'm in Reeder the vast majority of the time, but there are times I use ReadKit, Inoreader's app, and [lire](https://lireapp.com/). The setup isn't ideal, but it's not as bad as it sounds because 90% or more of my feed reading happens in Reeder. Still, the search continues for the perfect RSS reader and service. Lately, I've been trying [Feedly's Pro+ service](https://feedly.com/). I like that I can add notes and highlight articles. The service can also sort stories and highlight passages automatically using artificial intelligence, which is an interesting way to get through a large number of feeds. The problem is that those features only work on the articles in a feed. If something is truncated, which is common for larger websites, you need to visit the web version and lose Feedly's Pro+ features. Also, Feedly's apps, which are required to use those special features, aren't great.

 [![](https://mcusercontent.com/9f4b80a35728f7271fe3ea6ff/images/d5d93708-b0a7-4e68-6229-38fac166fb49.png)](https://cdn.macstories.net/screen-shot-2021-06-18-at-8-14-50-am-1624018505207.png) 

Feedly includes several unique features, but its apps aren't great.

As my exploration of feed readers has continued and better tools have emerged in other apps to markup, save, and organize things like PDFs and webpages, I've slowly come to the conclusion that what I really want is something that transcends feed readers. I want an app where RSS feeds are just another source of content, along with webpages, PDFs, and ebooks. Ideally, the app would have two modes: collection and curation, similar to the distinction between Reeder's feed reader and read later features.

Collection Mode would accept all the formats I mentioned above and provide a top-notch reading experience allowing it to serve as an RSS client, PDF reader, web browser, and ebook reader all in one. Items could be collected or sent to the app using RSS feeds, a built-in browser, browser extensions for all of the major browsers, the file system, the share sheet, Shortcuts, and even email.

In Curation Mode, the app would have to include comprehensive full-text and metadata search and the ability to save those searches, filter results, sort them, tag them, delete them or store them in folders, and mark items as starred or read. I'd also want the ability to batch process everything in the app.

But wait, there's more. You can highlight ebooks and PDFs in most apps that handle those files, but highlighting web content is far less common. I want that too. I want every bit of text in every document I read to be something that can be highlighted, annotated both from a keyboard or using an Apple Pencil, and have notes appended to it. I'd also like the ability to tag individual highlighted passages. This is what curation is all about: being able to take what you've collected and bend it to whatever research system works best for you.

One of the trickiest bits is that I'd also like this mythical research app to support a long list of highly-configurable export options. Personally, I would usually want nothing more than to extract plain text with a URL for the source material I highlight. However, I'd also like the ability to extract that text along with metadata like when it was captured, associated tags, the color of the highlighting, and more. I work in plain text, so that's critical, but the ideal research app should be able to adapt to different needs allowing for exports to PDF, Word, RTF, and even as image files.

Robust sharing and integration with other apps is a must too. Everything I collect should be shareable in multiple formats in as many apps as possible using the share sheet and a cloud-based for sharing as a link. Of course, the app should integrate with Shortcuts and include a web API to allow users to extend it in other ways.

It should go without saying, but the research tool I want has to work and be fully featured on the iPhone, iPad, and the Mac. There's no good excuse for feature-limited companion apps for the sort of research tool I'm imagining in 2021. Also, I want a consumer-oriented app, not one for someone writing a dissertation. There's a place for apps focused on academia, but I don't need fancy citation tools – URLs are fine – and I wouldn't want to introduce even more complexity to the app I'm imagining.

It's also worth mentioning the other features I wouldn't want. I don't want an everything bucket app or replacement for the file system. Research is a transitory phase between an idea and an outcome. The app I'm imaging should be a bus stop along that route, not the destination itself. Sure, I'd like to be able to store my research somewhere when I'm finished with it in case I need it another time, but there are plenty of apps that fit the bill for archiving and searching research material. My imaginary research app is just a pit stop. At the end of a project, I'm just as likely to delete whatever I've collected as I am to archive it, so I'd prefer to store reference material elsewhere.

There are other apps that do some or most of what I want, but not in a modern package that takes advantage of the latest technologies across all platforms. In any event, my wish is more about how my ideal research app is designed and works, than what it does.

I also don't want my research app to double as a text editor. It should be capable of generating text notes with basic formatting and links, but that's it. There are plenty of great text editors. Trying to fit a robust text editor into the sort of research tool I'm imagining is a bridge too far.

Too many apps try to be a destination. They lock information up, trying to be everything to everyone and create value by keeping users in their app. Perhaps paradoxically, the apps I value most are the ones that give me the most freedom to use other apps too. I may spend less time in an app like the one I've imagined than if it locked me into a rigid system, but the sort of flexibility that allows a tool to adapt to a wide variety of evolving contexts and workflows is the sort of app that I'll keep coming back to again and again.

## [Unread](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/unread-an-rss-reader/id1363637349?uo=4)

**John:** With the release of version 2.6 yesterday, Unread has added full-text search. Search is now part of the tools revealed when you swipe left in any article list. From the search results, there's a toggle to include all results or only those you haven't read yet and an option to search all articles by swiping left again. The feature searches the title, author, and text of an article, and if the related webpage has been cached, it will search that too, even if the text isn't part of the RSS post itself. Search can also be used to find individual subscriptions.

Another nice addition to Unread is a compact layout option that makes scrolling long lists of articles faster on smaller-screen devices. Unread subscribers can also add their saved articles to the app's widget with this week's update.

The feature works just like following artists, allowing you to keep up with the latest music released by your favorite labels. MusicHarbor also added DuckDuckGo as a news source this week and now links SongKick results on the web for upcoming concerts from the artists you follow instead of displaying them in the app.

## [Moodmonk](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/moodmonk-mood-journal/id1568114713?uo=4)

**John:** Moodmonk is a new mood-tracking app that lets you record and track your mood. The app goes a step further, though, with prompts designed to lift your spirits, cause you to reflect on positive thoughts, exercise, and more. The content that the app presents is tailored to the mood you report, nudging you in a positive direction.

## [Tripsy](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tripsy-travel-planner/id1429967544?uo=4)

**John:** Tripsy is [one of my favorite travel planning apps](https://www.macstories.net/reviews/tripsy-review-the-ultimate-trip-planner-for-iphone-and-ipad/) that sadly sat unused on my devices during the pandemic. With the situation improving in some parts of the world, though, I've begun thinking about visiting family and friends again, so the timing of Tripsy's update this week was perfect.

The update includes route details for the first time, displaying them on a map with travel times and distances, which is an excellent addition if you're planning a road trip this summer. There's also a new curated 3-day travel itinerary for Sydney, Australia. My favorite addition, though, is that Tripsy is also available on the Mac now too. The Mac Catalyst version of Tripsy looks fantastic on my MacBook Air's Retina screen and includes all of the functionality available in the iPhone and iPad versions.

### WWDC 2021 Straw Poll

*Twitter: [@ChristianSelig](https://twitter.com/ChristianSelig). Creator of [Apollo](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/apollo-for-reddit/id979274575).*

**Which of the new or updated frameworks make you want to drop support for older OS versions and why?**

The new Swift concurrency features around `async await` look really nice; I've been wanting to rewrite my networking stack for a while and it looks perfect. That and the new iPad keyboard APIs (both focusing with arrow keys and the new shortcuts overlay) as well as AttributedString improvements have me super excited for iOS 15.

**What impact do you expect this year's announcement will have on Apollo?**

I love these kind of releases where rather than one massive feature (widgets last year) we get an absolute flurry of slightly smaller ones. So I'm really excited that I get to add a ton of features and improvements to Apollo over the next year that in aggregate make the quality of life so much better for users. Plus I've been working hard at a new version that takes advantage of the iPad even better, and the new APIs in iOS and iPadOS 15 make a ton of things a lot easier and faster for me to do.

**If Apple goes back to in-person WWDCs in the future, what parts of the online event would you like to see preserved?**

I think a hybrid approach that makes labs accessible both in person and online, as well as airing (even prerecorded) sessions both online and in an in-person auditorium (like seeing a great movie with friends) would be terrific. That would strike a great balance between both remaining accessible, and remaining a great opportunity to get together in person with current friends and friends-to-be.

**Which system feature announced at WWDC are you looking forward to most as a user and why?**

I'm really looking forward to the new iPad multitasking interface changes. Prior to iOS 15 there were some areas that I just couldn't quite get down, and it made it tricky to multitask effectively, and with the new version I found it significantly easier to just pick up and get using. So I'm looking forward to a lot more multitasking and becoming a fully certified Power User™.

**Do you have any plans for Apollo that you'd like to share?**

Most of my plans going forward for Apollo are around bringing the iPad experience to the next level, and eventually the Mac after that, so that's been my focus and will continue to be, but I'm stoked a bunch of things around keyboard management have got a ton better, which makes things terrific for me and users. And you'll almost certainly see some SwiftUI in the app now! For the iOS 15 release specifically I'm experimenting with a few fun ideas using the new APIs, but I think I need a bit more time to play around with them before I land on anything concrete!
