uh I need to revise this, big time. after that first day, I placed Gladys in Copied's spot on my home screen (a big deal... like... it's been years since I'd moved it at all.)

...I don't think I've been so *usefully* bewildered by an app. and it still hasn't slowed or crashed, which would astonish you if you saw what I've tossed in there. 

among other things, thanks to Gladys' *care* with clipboard content (as in, it preserves more than I even thought the clipboard was *able* to contain, yet also parses between types of data (like plain and rich text, for instance) without any apparent processing??? ... along with a two-second tweak to Taio's default `Extract Content` action, I've got a ridiculously fast workflow for turning the rich text list of links that's returned when you copy all Safari tabs into a squeaky clean plain text list of *scrubbed* URLs to import straight into Raindrop.
