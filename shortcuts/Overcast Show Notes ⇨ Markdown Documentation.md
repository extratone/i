## About
This Shortcut was originally inspired by [@mralexhay‘s original](https://routinehub.co/shortcut/2343/) - which notably did not require Toolbox Pro, but is no longer functioning correctly.

It captures the show notes in HTML from the currently-playing episode in Overcast, converts the HTML to Rich Text, converts said Rich Text to Markdown, and returns the result in Quick Look.
