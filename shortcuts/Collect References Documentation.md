## About

[**Quick Video Demo**](https://youtube.com/shorts/HsHxynuZ6ZY) (YouTube)

I built this shortcut to aid in my own reading/research by collecting all of the hyperlinks from a given article/webpage and stashing them in a Bear note entitled “[Title of Article]” References. By default, it is also configured to add all of the URLs to one’s Safari Reading List, which can quickly turn into a mess, notably.

It *does* require the Toolbox Pro app for its URL extraction, but if you happen to really need a shortcut with a similar function and *do not* want to spend money on Toolbox Pro, please contact me via the methods below. (Seriously)
