AirPods

When your AirPods are nearby and ready to use with your Mac, you can use them to listen to music, use Siri or handle phone calls. Great for use with VoiceOver in shared environments and Voice Control / Dictation users when in noisy spaces.

Switch between noise cancellation and transparency modes while listening to audio from your Mac on AirPods Pro or AirPods Max.

Use AirPods with your Mac:
https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/mchld2f124d1/12.0/mac/

-----
Announce Time

For Clock, you can set options to customize how the time and the date appear in the menu bar. To hear the time announced, select the “Announce the time” tick box, then choose when you want it announced and the voice used for the announcements.

Change Dock &amp; Menu Bar preferences on Mac:
https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/mchlp1119/12.0/mac/



-----
Apps in Full Screen

Many apps on your Mac support full-screen mode — an app fills the entire screen — so you can take advantage of every inch of the screen and work without desktop distractions.

Use apps in full screen on Mac:
https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/mchl9c21d2be/mac



-----
Audio Descriptions

Watch movies with detailed audio descriptions of every scene. Movies with audio descriptions are displayed with the AD icon in the iTunes Store. 

VoiceOver users can access closed caption and subtitle tracks audibly or through their Braille displays.

Turn on audio descriptions on your Mac:
https://support.apple.com/HT205800

Use audio descriptions to hear narration describing a video clip, show, or movie:
https://support.apple.com/HT204657 

Check if films and TV shows have accessibility features in the Apple TV app:

-----
Auto-Correction

In many macOS apps, spelling is checked while you type, and mistakes are automatically corrected. You can turn off these features, and use other options while typing emails, messages or documents.

Check spelling and grammar on Mac:
https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/mh35735/mac

Set up Auto-Correction and add words to your dictionary in Pages, Numbers and Keynote:
https://support.apple.com/HT207767



-----
Color Filters

If you have color blindness or other vision challenges, you can use Color Filters to help you differentiate between colors. 
You can apply a color filter to adjust the display colors for colour vision deficiencies or to tint the entire screen to make it easier to read text.

When you turn on Color Filters, you can choose from four preset filters:
- Grayscale
- Red/Green for Protanopia
- Green/Red for Deuteranopia
- Blue/Yellow for Tritanopia

Or you can customize a Color Tint to change the hue of the entire display on your Mac. Use the sliders to adjust your display's hue and the intensity of the effect.

Color Filters can change the look of things, like pictures and movies, so you might want to use it only when needed.

Dark Mode

Dark Mode makes it easier to stay focused on your work, because your content stands out while darkened controls and windows recede into the background.

Dark Mode is easy on your eyes and helps you focus on your work. Dark Mode uses a dark colour scheme that works system-wide, including with the apps that come with your Mac. And third-party apps can adopt it, too.

Dark Mode is available in Control Center Display for quick access to this feature.

Dictation

Dictation lets you talk wherever you would type. It’s easy to type an email, notes, or a web address — without typing at all. Dictation works in over 30 languages. Just go to any text field and enable. 

Turn it on in the Dictation pane of Keyboard preferences. A feedback window gauges your speaking volume and provides basic dictation controls.

FaceTime

If you use sign language, FaceTime is an ideal way to communicate. The high-quality video and fast frame rate help you catch every gesture or expression.

When you’re signed in and FaceTime is turned on, you can create a link for a FaceTime call, then share that link with anyone using any device (Apple, Android or Windows). As the link originator, you need to start the call, then allow each user to join.

Facial Recognition in Photos

The Photos app scans your photos to help you quickly recognize the people, scenes, and objects within the photos. You can name the people in your photos, mark your favorites, and more. Depending on the number of photos that you have, you can watch a Memory movie of them. And when you have iCloud Photos turned on, the people you favorite or name stay up to date across your Apple devices.

Switch Control

Switch Control makes it easy and efficient to control your device with a variety of adaptive switch hardware, wireless game controllers, or even simple sounds. If you have extensive motor limitations, you can use item, point, and manual scanning to navigate sequentially through onscreen keyboards, menus, and the Dock. Create your own custom panels and keyboards, systemwide or app by app. 

If you use Switch Control or the Accessibility Keyboard on your Mac, you can use the Panel Editor to add custom panels to the Switch Control or Accessibility Keyboard panel collection, to streamline common tasks and actions for different apps on your Mac. You can also use the panels on another Mac, or share them with other Switch Control or Accessibility Keyboard users.

Platform Switching allows you to use a single device to navigate any other devices you have synced with your iCloud account. That way, you can control your Mac directly from your iPhone or iPad without having to set up your switches on each new device.

VoiceOver

VoiceOver is an industry‑leading screen reader that tells you exactly what’s happening on your device. VoiceOver can now describe people, objects, text, and graphs in greater detail than ever. Auditory descriptions of elements help you easily navigate your screen through a Bluetooth keyboard or simple gestures on a trackpad. And with unique rotor gestures that function like a dial on trackpads, you can make content such as websites a breeze to browse.

Use the VoiceOver Recognition pane in VoiceOver Utility to enable VoiceOver to describe images in apps and on websites using on-device intelligence to improve accessibility. You can download languages to hear image descriptions in other languages.

Make your VoiceOver preferences “portable” by storing them on an external drive. You can then easily use your settings on other Mac computers and keep an up-to-date copy of your current settings always available.

VoiceOver + Braille

For many users, a braille display may be easier and more efficient than a standard keyboard — and for deaf-blind users, it is a requirement. VoiceOver can give descriptions of exactly what’s on your screen, in braille. You can use a refreshable braille display connected via Bluetooth to your Apple device. Braille is automatically converted to text in a caption panel on Mac so sighted people can follow along with VoiceOver descriptions. 

With over 100 refreshable braille displays compatible with macOS, you can find the right braille experience for you.

VoiceOver Accessible Signature and Images

Add a VoiceOver description of a signature when you create one in Preview. This is especially useful if you create multiple signatures and need to distinguish between them to ensure you use the intended signature. Before you click or tap Done, click the Description pop-up menu, then choose a description, such as Initials, or choose Custom to create your own description. When you're ready to sign a PDF document, navigate the list of signatures using VoiceOver. When you hear the description of the signature you want to use, press VO-Space bar to select it.

Use this feature in any photos or items In Preview. Once this text has been added in Descriptions, VoiceOver will announce this text, giving valuable context to blind on low vision users.

And in TextEdit, Predictive Text offers the perfect next word.Choose Edit > Complete (or press Option-Esc) to create a drop down list of predictive words in native apps like TextEdit and Mail. To select one of the words from the list, use the arrow keys to go up and down to the correct word then press space, or double click the word. 
Word Completion does not work in Pages.

Zoom

Zoom is a screen magnifier that lets you enlarge the content you see on your device. Choose from full‑screen magnification or picture‑in‑picture view, which shows the magnified area in a separate window while the rest of your screen stays the same. Zoom also works with VoiceOver, so you can better see and hear what’s happening on your screen.

Zoom Display on Mac lets you see content up close and at a distance simultaneously. With two displays, you can keep one zoomed in while the other stays at a standard resolution for a customizable, multizoom setup.
