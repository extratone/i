Activity App for wheelchair users

If you own an Apple Watch, reach your fitness goals with the Activity app on Apple Watch, designed with wheelchair users in mind. Instead of a Stand goal, the Roll goal encourages you to move every hour. And sensors in Apple Watch even take into account different pushing techniques — giving you the most accurate credit for your daily activity.

The Workout app on Apple Watch helps you work out your way. Accurately measure your workout session and set time, distance, or calorie goals based on the type of exercise you do. For wheelchair users, there are two unique workouts types: Outdoor Wheelchair Walk Pace and Outdoor Wheelchair Run Pace. Just choose the workout type that best matches your activity and Apple Watch turns on the appropriate sensors to track your workout.

To enable health and fitness features designed for wheelchair activity, edit the wheelchair preference in the Health section of My Watch or in the Health app under Health Details.

Use the Health app on your iPhone or iPod touch:

Color Filters

If you have color blindness or other vision challenges, you can use Color Filters to help you differentiate between colors. Color Filters can change the look of things, like pictures and movies, so you might want to use it only when needed.

When you turn on Color Filters, you can choose from four preset filters:
- Grayscale
- Red/Green for Protanopia
- Green/Red for Deuteranopia
- Blue/Yellow for Tritanopia

Or you can customize a Color Tint to change the hue of the entire display on your iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch. Use the sliders to adjust your display's hue and the intensity of the effect.

Conversation Boost

Conversation Boost focuses your AirPods Pro on the person who's talking in front of you. This makes it easier to hear when you're talking face to face.

You can turn on Conversation Boost by tapping the Hearing button in Control Centre.

Noise Cancellation in Headphones

AirPods Pro and AirPods Max have three noise-control modes: Active Noise Cancellation, Transparency mode, and Off. You can switch between them, depending on how much of your surroundings you want to hear.

With Active Noise Cancellation, an outward-facing microphone or microphones detect external sounds, which your AirPods Pro or AirPods Max then counter with anti-noise, canceling the external sounds before you hear them. An inward-facing microphone listens inside your ear for unwanted internal sounds, which your AirPods Pro or AirPods Max also counter with anti-noise.

You can also turn on noise cancellation even when you’re using only one of your AirPods.

Couple this feature with Live Listen for better conversations. Access many of these settings easily in Control Center.

Quickpath

Use QuickPath to type a word by sliding from one letter to the next without lifting your finger on the native keyboard (not available for all languages). To end a word, lift your finger. You can use either method as you type, and even switch in the middle of a sentence. (If you tap  after sliding to type a word, it deletes the whole word.)

On iPad, you can pinch closed to shrink the keyboard, then tap individual keys to type, or use QuickPath.

Platform Switching allows you to use a single device to navigate any other devices you have synced with your iCloud account. That way, you can control your Mac or Apple TV directly from your iPhone or iPad, without having to set up your switches on each new device.

Head Tracking uses the camera on your device to track the movement of your head to control a pointer on your screen. Use facial movements to perform actions. You can use Head Tracking on devices with a front-facing TrueDepth camera within Switch Control.

Sound Actions for Switch Control replaces physical buttons and switches with mouth sounds — such as a click, pop, or “ee” sound — for users who are non-speaking and have limited mobility.

Widgets

Widgets have been redesigned to give you more information at a glance—and now you can add them to your Home Screen. Choose from different sizes and arrange them however you like. You can also add a Smart Stack that displays widgets based on factors like your location, an activity, or the time. 

To support quick access to Shortcuts, add them as a Widget to your home screen. For example, add a Help Message Shortcut that sends a message to trusted contacts stating you need assistance and your location.

Zoom

Zoom is a screen magnifier that lets you enlarge the content you see on your device. Choose from full‑screen magnification or picture‑in‑picture view, which shows the magnified area in a separate window while the rest of your screen stays the same. Zoom also works with VoiceOver, so you can better see and hear what’s happening on your screen.
