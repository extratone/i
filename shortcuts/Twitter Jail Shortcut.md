## The quickest means to find yourself in Twitter jail.

### Requirements
- [**Actions**](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/actions/id1586435171) - Free across all platforms and just 3.3mb to download!
- [Tweetbot](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tweetbot-6-for-twitter/id1527500834) (You might also try [Aviary](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/aviary-for-twitter/id1522043420) if you absolutely cannot bring yourself to pay a subscription fee, ever.) 
- [Data Jar](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/data-jar/id1453273600) (More or less optional)

This shortcut rapidly Tweets randomized strings of text until you're jailed. I recommend you leave the count at 400, just to be safe. Optionally, you can also specify a Data Jar List to store the resulting URLs in. And obviously, you'll need to specify which of your Twitter accounts you'd like to send to jail as well upon installation.

Back in my day, I had to pound out each Tweet by hand to get myself jailed. You youngsters just get to sit back and watch.
