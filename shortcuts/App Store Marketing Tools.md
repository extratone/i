## Select an app from an App Store search to open its corresponding "App Store Marketing Tools" page.

I created this Shortcut largely to establish a direct translation between the user-facing App Store and Apple's new "[App Store Marketing Tools](https://tools.applemediaservices.com/app-store)" tool, the frontend of which notably *actually functions as a search tool* as opposed to the user-facing search function in the App Store Apps. 

It does so using a simple URL scheme (`https://tools.applemediaservices.com/app/<selected app's numerical store ID>`)

1. Text prompt to search the App Store
2. Retrieves `Store ID` from selected App
3. Appends `Store ID` at the end of `https://tools.applemediaservices.com/app/`
4. Copies the resulting URL to the clipboard
5. Opens resulting URL in Safari
