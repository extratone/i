**Federico**: While I use the ping-my-iPhone [Apple Watch feature](https://www.imore.com/how-find-your-iphone-your-apple-watch) multiple times a week, I've often found myself wishing it'd be a little louder so I can more easily know my iPhone is within reach. For example, when my girlfriend and I go out at night and walk around Rome with our dogs, I often ask her to keep my iPhone and car keys in her purse so I can keep small dog treats in my pockets. And because I can be a bit paranoid about losing my iPhone, I frequently ping it from my Watch, but I may not hear it if we're in a crowded place. Furthermore, I've noticed that if we have music playing around the house (for context, we have three HomePods and a Sonos One set up via AirPlay 2), I sometimes struggle to locate my iPhone based on the default pinging sound alone.

I was thinking about this problem last week, and I came up with a simple but effective custom shortcut that I can use in addition to the built-in iPhone pinging feature of the Apple Watch. In fact, the shortcut I've put together can be triggered from an Apple Watch or HomePod connected to an iPhone.

The shortcut is comprised of two primary functionalities: a summary message with basic information about the iPhone we're trying to locate, and a repeat loop that will play a notification sound, toggle the flashlight, and vibrate the device multiple times in a row. The summary message, based on a 'Show Result' action, is built with Magic Variables generated by native actions that allow Shortcuts to read information about an iPhone. In my shortcut, these details include the device's nickname and its current battery level. You could add more information if you want (such as reading the name of the network the device is currently connected to), but I wanted to keep the introductory message as brief as possible given that the shortcut's primary purpose is to actually find an iPhone.

After displaying a message, the shortcut prepares for a repeat loop by setting the system volume to highest level and disabling Do Not Disturb. Then, it starts repeating a series of Set Flashlight-Play Sound-Vibrate Device actions that do exactly what you'd expect: they toggle the flashlight on and off, play a default notification sound followed by a rapid vibration, then start over again.

By default, these actions are executed twice in a Repeat block that runs for 10 times, which means your iPhone will rapidly play 20 sounds and vibrate 20 times. The number of repetitions can be configured in a 'Number' action, and you can go as high or low as you want. I once set the number to 50 and let me tell you - it was quite the experience.

I created this shortcut for those extreme cases when I can't hear the Apple Watch pinging my iPhone and need an aggressive, over-the-top solution to locate my iPhone. I wouldn't run this shortcut every few minutes when my XS Max is in Silvia's purse because it would drive her crazy. Technically speaking however, as a last resort, I find it remarkable that the Apple Watch and HomePod can execute this shortcut on my iPhone, in the background, even if the device is locked.

This shortcut is just a fun example of the flexibility granted by native system actions in the Shortcuts app, but it proves an important point: this wouldn't have been possible with Workflow as a third-party app lacking the deep Siri integration of Shortcuts.
