## About
This Shortcut retrieves the Song.Link/Odesli page URL for the track currently playing, copies said URL to the clipboard, and opens the URL in Safari. 

I have it titled “SL” so - if I feel like sharing the current track - all I need to do is type “sl” to Siri and its Song.Link page opens in Safari (mainly to make sure it’s the proper page.)

# Version 1.2
2021-04-28-02.47.38
I removed the copy to clipboard action from the Shortcut and updated it accordingly on RoutineHub today - it turns out, it was just copying the entire URL from whatever streaming service `eg: song.link/youtube.com/thelink instead of song.link.com/correctlink` which needlessly adds to the already-overwhelming number of API requests they’re experiencing right now. Instead, just tap the small “copy link” text (first of three buttons, by default.)
