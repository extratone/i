## The definitive lost-in-the-couch solution.
(**Note**: This Shortcut is _currently in BETA_ and requires iOS 14.5 Beta 8 in order to replicate the function demonstrated above.)

**THIS VERSION INCLUDES PROFANITY**
If you’re a potential tester who would prefer a clean version, _please do contact me_ via the methods below. I appreciate your interest and want to accommodate you any way I can.

The idea for this Shortcut dates back to iOS 12 Beta - when I first encountered Siri Shortcuts. For whatever reason, it didn’t take long for me to want a sort of call-and-return Shortcut for those (far too numerous) cases when I’d left my iPhone somewhere obscured in the room.

### Marco! as it stands is a 48-action Siri Shortcut designed to be triggered by Hey Siri! in the event of a lost phone. 

In this full, original version, **you’ll hear my actual voice** at the beginning, followed by a short song sample, and then a variety of shenanigans narrated by the new Siri Voice 2.

### Here are the steps in full:
1. Turn Low Power Mode OFF
2. Turn Airplane Mode OFF
3. Turn Wi-Fi On
4. Turn Bluetooth On
5. Set brightness to 100%
6. Turn Do Not Disturb OFF
7. Turn appearance Light
8. Set playback destination to iPhone
9. Set volume to 89%
10. Vibrate device (Not currently working.)
11. Play **my voice** saying “Polo!” + a few other items
12. Toggle (flash) the flashlight 17 times (odd number leaving your flashlight on constantly unless it was on before the Shortcut was triggered)
13. Play a clip of Nasenbluten’s “[Blinded](https://bloodyfistrecords.bandcamp.com/track/blinded)”
14. **Siri Voice 2 Monologue #1** including GPS Lat/Long and Altitude (yes, I realize this isn’t particularly useful.)
15. Default notification sound plays 3 times
16. **Siri Voice 2 Monologue #2** is a theatrical reading of the infamous [Navy SEAL Copypasta](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/navy-seal-copypasta).
17. Plays a farewell in **my voice** 
18. Shows a goodbye notification
19. Plays the entirety of Sarah MacLachlan’s “[Angel](https://song.link/us/i/290584107)”
