`If you thought this Shortcut was anything other than what it is, I sincerely apologize!`

## About
I created this Shortcut because I kept finding myself in conversations with new aquaintences forgetting one particular statistic about Spotify’s true value as a tool for music “Discovery.”

## Steps
1. A notification is shown with an excerpt from an op-ed in *Pitchfork* by Damon Krukowski entitled “[How to Be a Responsible Music Fan in the Age of Streaming](https://pitchfork.com/features/oped/how-to-be-a-responsible-music-fan-in-the-age-of-streaming/).”
2. A raw audio file of Siri Simone (Siri Voice 2) speaking said excerpt aloud is retrieved from my NeoCities site. (*Subject to be replaced by a local Base64-enabled process as soon as Base64 in Shortcuts is fixed.*)
3. The audio file is played aloud.
4. The statistic - followed by the raw URL of the op-ed - is copied to the clipboard.
5. The URL of the op-ed is opened in Safari and added to one’s Safari Reading List.
6. The URL to my own semi-academic essay - “[Concerning Discovery in Streaming Music](https://bilge.world/streaming-music-discovery)” - is opened in Safari and added to one’s Safari Reading List.
7. The text from `Step 5` is passed to the native Twitter app as a new Tweet.
