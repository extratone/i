At the moment, the Safari Reader action upon which my iOS-borned Siri Speech Synthesis Shortcutdepends is not functioning on MacOS, so I’ve created this (hopefully temporary) solution that performs 11the same function, though it will require you to select and/or copy the body of an article to the clipboard yourself.

I’d love to tell you I’ve been intentionally waiting to release a MacOS equivalent to my Siri Speech Synthesis shortcut until the Safari Reader action was fixed, but I wasn’t able to actually try it until a few days ago… but…

anywho. I HAVE published the closest equivalent I could manifest, which will involve you doing the work of the absentee Reader (selecting the body text you’d like read aloud,) though it seems pretty discriminating so far. https://routinehub.co/shortcut/10583

unfortunately the result uh… sucks. I’m sure I could investigate and find out why it sounds like Simone Siri is missing a few billion dollars worth of research on MacOS compared to iOS, but it doesn’t seem like you care, so… https://bilge.world/software-thanksgiving
